For example, the Enumeration Characteristic represents the concept \"one of multiple predefined values\". In order to use the Characteristic, an instance of it must be specified in the corresponding Aspect Model, that determines which values are valid for the respective Property. The following diagram shows the Characteristics Classes defined in the scope of the Semantic Aspect Meta Model. urn:samm:org.eclipse.esmf.samm:characteristic:2.1.0#Characteristic Base class of all characteristics. This Characteristics Class can also be instantiated directly (i.e., without creating a subclass). See declaring characteristics for usage in an Aspect Model. Attributes Description Required samm:preferredName Human readable name in a specific language samm:description Human readable description in a specific language samm:dataType Reference to a scalar or complex (Entity) data type. See Section \"Type System\" in the Aspect Meta Model urn:samm:org.eclipse.esmf.samm:characteristic:2.1.0#Trait The Trait is used to add one or more Constraints to another Characteristic, which is referred to as the \"base Characteristic\". A Trait itself has no samm:dataType, because it inherits the type of its samm-c:baseCharacteristic. See declaring constraints for usage in an Aspect Model. Attributes Description Required samm-c:baseCharacteristic The Characterstic that is being constrained samm-c:constraint A Constraint that is applicable to the base Characteristic. This attribute may be used multiple times, to add multiple Constraints to the base Characteristic. urn:samm:org.eclipse.esmf.samm:characteristic:2.1.0#Quantifiable A value which can be quantified and may have a unit, e.g., the number of bolts required for a processing step or the expected torque with which these bolts should be tightened. See declaring characteristics for usage in an Aspect Model. Attributes Description Required samm-c:unit Reference to a Unit as defined in the Unit catalog urn:samm:org.eclipse.esmf.samm:characteristic:2.1.0#Measurement A measurement is a numeric value with an associated unit and quantity kind. See declaring characteristics for usage in an Aspect Model. Attributes Description Required samm-c:unit Reference to a Unit as defined in the Unit catalog urn:samm:org.eclipse.esmf.samm:characteristic:2.1.0#Enumeration An enumeration represents a list of possible values. See declaring enumerations for usage in an Aspect Model. Attributes Description Required samm-c:values List of possible values. The dataType of each of the values must match the dataType of the Enumeration. urn:samm:org.eclipse.esmf.samm:characteristic:2.1.0#State A state is subclass of Enumeration with a default value. See declaring state for usage in an Aspect Model. Attributes Description Required samm-c:defaultValue The default value for the state urn:samm:org.eclipse.esmf.samm:characteristic:2.1.0#Duration A time duration. Attributes Description Required samm-c:unit Reference to a Unit as defined in the Unit catalog. The referenced unit or its referenceUnit must have the quantityKind unit:time. Currently, the following units can therefore be used: unit:centipoisePerBar unit:commonYear unit:day unit:henryPerKiloohm unit:henryPerOhm unit:hour unit:kilosecond unit:microhenryPerKiloohm unit:microhenryPerOhm unit:microsecond unit:millihenryPerKiloohm unit:millihenryPerOhm unit:millipascalSecondPerBar unit:millisecond unit:minuteUnitOfTime unit:month unit:nanosecond unit:pascalSecondPerBar unit:picosecond unit:poisePerBar unit:poisePerPascal unit:reciprocalMinute unit:secondUnitOfTime unit:shake unit:siderealYear unit:tropicalYear unit:week unit:year urn:samm:org.eclipse.esmf.samm:characteristic:2.1.0#Collection A group of values which may be either of a scalar or Entity type. The values may be duplicated and are not ordered (i.e., bag semantics). See declaring collections for usage in an Aspect Model. Attributes Description Required samm:dataType Reference to a scalar or complex (Entity) data type. See Section \"Type System\" in the Aspect Meta Model. samm-c:elementCharacteristic Reference to a Characteristic which describes the individual elements contained in the Collection. urn:samm:org.eclipse.esmf.samm:characteristic:2.1.0#List A subclass of Collection which may contain duplicates and is ordered. urn:samm:org.eclipse.esmf.samm:characteristic:2.1.0#Set A subclass of Collection which may not contain duplicates and is unordered. urn:samm:org.eclipse.esmf.samm:characteristic:2.1.0#SortedSet A subclass of Collection which may not contain duplicates and is ordered. urn:samm:org.eclipse.esmf.samm:characteristic:2.1.0#TimeSeries A subclass of Sorted Set containing values with the exact point in time when the values where recorded. See declaring time series for usage in an Aspect Model. Attributes Description Required samm:dataType Set to samm-e:TimeSeriesEntity. This Entity consists of two Properties, namely samm-e:timestamp and samm-e:value. As such the structure for time series data is fixed to a collection of key/value pairs with the timestamp being the key and the value being the value. The samm-e:timestamp property has a fixed Characteristic of samm-c:Timestamp. The Characteristic of the samm-e:value Property is set in the specific Aspect Model giving the value domain specific semantics. urn:samm:org.eclipse.esmf.samm:characteristic:2.1.0#Code Describes a Property which contains any kind of code. Note that this Characteristic does not define a samm:dataType, this must therefore be done when instantiating the Characteristic. urn:samm:org.eclipse.esmf.samm:characteristic:2.1.0#Either Describes a Property whose value can have one of two possible types (a disjoint union). This Characteristic does not have one explicit samm:dataType, as it can be the datatype of either the left or the right. See declaring either for usage in an Aspect Model. Attributes Description Required samm-c:left The left side of the Either. The attribute references another Characteristic which describes the value. samm-c:right The right side of the Either. The attribute references another Characteristic which describes the value. urn:samm:org.eclipse.esmf.samm:characteristic:2.1.0#SingleEntity Describes a Property whose data type is an Entity. The Entity used as data type could be defined in the same Aspect Model or the shared Entity namespace of the Semantic Aspect Meta Model. See declaring characteristics for usage in an Aspect Model. urn:samm:org.eclipse.esmf.samm:characteristic:2.1.0#StructuredValue Describes a Property which contains a scalar string-like value space value with a well-defined structure. The Structured Value Characteristic allows the description of the parts of the Property’s value by linking to a separate Property definition for each part. To define the parts, the value must be deconstructed using a regular expression. See declaring structured value for usage in an Aspect Model. Attributes Description Required samm-c:deconstructionRule The regular expression used to deconstruct the value into parts that are mapped to separate Properties. This regular expression must contain the same number of capture groups as there are Properties given in the elements list. The n​th capture group maps to the n​th Property in the elements list. samm-c:elements A list of entries each of which can either be a Property reference or a string literal. The list must contain at least one Property reference. Concatenating the values of the Properties in the elements list with the string literals in the given order should yield a value that corresponds to the original value that has this Structured Value Characteristic. While the deconstructionRule is used for deconstruction, the string literals in the elements list are used for construction. When the Property using the Structured Value Characteristic also defines an exampleValue, construction and deconstruction of the value are tested when validating the model. A number of concrete Characteristics are defined in conjunction with the Aspect Meta Model. They can be used as-is as Characteristics for Properties in Aspect Models. The following diagram shows the Characteristics Instances defined in the scope of the Semantic Aspect Meta Model. urn:samm:org.eclipse.esmf.samm:characteristic:2.1.0#Timestamp Describes a Property which contains the date and time with an optional timezone. dataType: xsd:dateTime urn:samm:org.eclipse.esmf.samm:characteristic:2.1.0#Text Describes a Property which contains plain text. This is intended exclusively for human readable strings, not for identifiers, measurement values, etc. dataType: xsd:string urn:samm:org.eclipse.esmf.samm:characteristic:2.1.0#MultiLanguageText Describes a Property which contains plain text in multiple languages. This is intended exclusively for human readable strings, not for identifiers, measurement values, etc. dataType: rdf:langString urn:samm:org.eclipse.esmf.samm:characteristic:2.1.0#Language Describes a Property containing a language according to ISO 639-1 [iso639], for example \"de\". dataType: xsd:string urn:samm:org.eclipse.esmf.samm:characteristic:2.1.0#Locale Describes a Property containing a locale according to IETF BCP 47 [bcp47], for example \"de-DE\". dataType: xsd:string urn:samm:org.eclipse.esmf.samm:characteristic:2.1.0#Boolean Represents a boolean value (i.e., a \"flag\"). dataType: xsd:boolean urn:samm:org.eclipse.esmf.samm:characteristic:2.1.0#ResourcePath Describes a Property that contains the path to a relative or absolute resource. dataType: xsd:anyURI urn:samm:org.eclipse.esmf.samm:characteristic:2.1.0#MimeType Describes a Property that contains a MIME type as defined by RFC 2046 [rfc2046], for example \"application/json\", \"application/xls\" or \"image/png\". dataType: xsd:string urn:samm:org.eclipse.esmf.samm:characteristic:2.1.0#UnitReference Describes a Property containing a reference to one of the units in the Unit catalog. See Using Unit Reference for usage in an Aspect Model. dataType: samm:curie urn:samm:org.eclipse.esmf.samm:characteristic:2.1.0#Reference A reference is a value that refers to a concept such as a resource or a model element. It can be a SAMM meta model identifier, a SAMM model element identifier, a resource URI, or a URI referring to a concept in a different formalism or vocabulary. The value follows the same rules as a samm:see reference. See declaring Reference for usage in an Aspect Model. urn:samm:org.eclipse.esmf.samm:characteristic:2.1.0#Constraint Base class for other constraints that constrain a Characteristic in some way, e.g., the Range Constraint limits the value range for a Property. The Constraint class has no attributes. urn:samm:org.eclipse.esmf.samm:characteristic:2.1.0#LanguageConstraint Restricts a value to a specific language. Attributes Description Required samm-c:languageCode An ISO 639-1 [iso639] language code for the language of the value of the constrained Property, e.g., \"de\". urn:samm:org.eclipse.esmf.samm:characteristic:2.1.0#LocaleConstraint Restricts a value to a specific locale, i.e., a language with additional region information. Attributes Description Required samm-c:localeCode An IETF BCP 47 [bcp47] language code for the locale of the value of the constrained Property, e.g., \"de-DE\". urn:samm:org.eclipse.esmf.samm:characteristic:2.1.0#RangeConstraint Restricts the value range of a Property. At least one of samm-c:maxValue or samm-c:minValue must be present in a Range Constraint. Whether the samm-c:maxValue and samm-c:minValue are inclusive or exclusive can be defined using the samm-c:upperBoundDefinition and samm-c:lowerBoundDefinition attributes. When one or both of them are not specified, the corresponding value defaults to inclusive. The values for maxValue and minValue must be given in the same effective dataType that the constrained Characteristic uses. Attributes Description Required samm-c:maxValue The upper bound of a range samm-c:minValue The lower bound of a range samm-c:upperBoundDefinition Defines whether the upper bound of a range is inclusive or exclusive. Possible values are samm-c:AT_MOST and samm-c:LESS_THAN samm-c:lowerBoundDefinition Defines whether the lower bound of a range is inclusive or exclusive. Possible values are samm-c:AT_LEAST and samm-c:GREATER_THAN When either the samm-c:minValue or the samm-c:maxValue is not given, the Range is defined as having an open lower or upper boundary. The AT_LEAST and AT_MOST values for lowerBoundDefinition and upperBoundDefinition define that the values for minValue and maxValue are inclusive. The LESS_THAN and GREATER_THAN values for the lowerBoundDefinition and upperBoundDefinition define that the values for minValue and maxValue are exclusive. This Constraint can be used to restrict Characteristics with one of two kinds of data types: Characteristics that have a numeric data type; in this case the Constraint restricts the range of the value. The scalar data types that can be restricted are: xsd:double, xsd:float, xsd:decimal, xsd:integer, xsd:byte, xsd:short, xsd:int, xsd:long, xsd:unsignedByte, xsd:unsignedShort, xsd:unsignedInt, xsd:unsignedLong, xsd:positiveInteger , xsd:nonPositiveInteger, xsd:negativeInteger and xsd:nonNegativeInteger. Characteristics that have a time and date data type; in this case the Constraint restricts the scalar data types: xsd:date,xsd:time, xsd:dateTime, xsd:dateTimeStamp, xsd:gYear, xsd:gMonth, xsd:gMonthDay, xsd:duration, xsd:yearMonthDuration, xsd:dayTimeDuration. urn:samm:org.eclipse.esmf.samm:characteristic:2.1.0#EncodingConstraint Restricts the encoding of a Property. Attributes Description Required samm:value Configures the encoding. This must be one of the following: samm:US-ASCII, samm:ISO-8859-1, samm:UTF-8, samm:UTF-16, samm:UTF-16BE or samm:UTF-16LE. The default encoding for values with a string-like value space is UTF-8, therefore using an Encoding Constraint with a samm:value of samm:UTF-8 is only necessary when a Property’s encoding is changed during an Aspect Model version increase from some other encoding to UTF-8 to indicate that the other encoding is not any longer used. urn:samm:org.eclipse.esmf.samm:characteristic:2.1.0#LengthConstraint This Constraint can be used to restrict two types of Characteristics: Characteristics that have a string-like value space; in this case the Constraint restricts the length of the (string-) value. The scalar data types that can be restricted are: xsd:string, xsd:date, xsd:time, xsd:dateTime, xsd:dateTimeStamp, xsd:gYear, xsd:gMonth, xsd:gMonthDay, xsd:duration, xsd:yearMonthDuration, xsd:dayTimeDuration, xsd:hexBinary, xsd:base64Binary, xsd:anyURI, samm:curie and rdf:langString. Collection Characteristics (Collection, Set, Sorted Set, List). In this case the Constraint restricts the number of elements in the collection. At least one of samm-c:maxValue or samm-c:minValue must be present in a Length Constraint. Attributes Description Required samm-c:maxValue The maximum length. Must be given as xsd:nonNegativeInteger. samm-c:minValue The minimum length. Must be given as xsd:nonNegativeInteger. When using the samm-c:minValue parameter in Length Constraint, it is crucial to consider the following: Creating a Model with a Set/Sorted Set based on a finite Base Characteristic (Boolean or Enumeration) and adding Length Constraint, the samm-c:minValue must not exceed the total number of elements in the Base Characteristic. Models with such conditions are not recognized as invalid, but no valid payloads can exist for them. urn:samm:org.eclipse.esmf.samm:characteristic:2.1.0#RegularExpressionConstraint Restricts a string value to a regular expression as defined by XQuery 1.0 and XPath 2.0 Functions and Operators [xpath-functions]. Attributes Description Required samm:value The regular expression urn:samm:org.eclipse.esmf.samm:characteristic:2.1.0#FixedPointConstraint Defines the scaling factor as well as the amount of integral numbers for a fixed point number. The constraint may only be used in conjunction with Characteristics which use the xsd:decimal data type. Attributes Description Required samm-c:scale The scaling factor for a fixed point number. E.g., if a fixedpoint number is 123.04, the scaling factor is 2 (the number of digits after the decimal point). Must be given as xsd:positiveInteger. samm-c:integer The number of integral digits for a fixed point number. E.g., if a fixedpoint number is 123.04, the integer factor is 3 (the number of digits before the decimal point). Must be given as xsd:positiveInteger.","title":"Characteristics and Constraints","component":"samm-specification","version":"snapshot","name":"characteristics","url":"/samm-specification/snapshot/characteristics.html","titles":[{"text":"Characteristics Classes","id":"characteristics-classes"},{"text":"Characteristic","id":"characteristic-characteristic"},{"text":"Trait","id":"trait-characteristic"},{"text":"Quantifiable","id":"quantifiable-characteristic"},{"text":"Measurement","id":"measurement-characteristic"},{"text":"Enumeration","id":"enumeration-characteristic"},{"text":"State","id":"state-characteristic"},{"text":"Duration","id":"duration-characteristic"},{"text":"Collection","id":"collection-characteristic"},{"text":"List","id":"list-characteristic"},{"text":"Set","id":"set-characteristic"},{"text":"Sorted Set","id":"sorted-set-characteristic"},{"text":"Time Series","id":"time-series-characteristic"},{"text":"Code","id":"code-characteristic"},{"text":"Either","id":"either-characteristic"},{"text":"Single Entity","id":"single-entity-characteristic"},{"text":"Structured Value","id":"structured-value-characteristic"},{"text":"Characteristics Instances","id":"characteristics-instances"},{"text":"Timestamp","id":"timestamp-characteristic"},{"text":"Text","id":"text-characteristic"},{"text":"Multi-Language Text","id":"multi-language-text-characteristic"},{"text":"Language","id":"language-characteristic"},{"text":"Locale","id":"locale-characteristic"},{"text":"Boolean","id":"boolean-characteristic"},{"text":"Resource Path","id":"resource-path-characteristic"},{"text":"MIME Type","id":"mime-type-characteristic"},{"text":"Unit Reference","id":"unit-reference-characteristic"},{"text":"Reference","id":"reference-characteristic"},{"text":"Constraints","id":"constraints"},{"text":"Constraint","id":"constraint"},{"text":"Language Constraint","id":"language-constraint"},{"text":"Locale Constraint","id":"locale-constraint"},{"text":"Range Constraint","id":"range-constraint"},{"text":"Encoding Constraint","id":"encoding-constraint"},{"text":"Length Constraint","id":"length-constraint"},{"text":"Regular Expression Constraint","id":"regular-expression-constraint"},{"text":"Fixed Point Constraint","id":"fixed-point-constraint"}]},"/samm-specification/snapshot/datatypes.html":{"text":"The system of types used in the Semantic Aspect Meta Model (and subsequently in the models conforming to the Semantic Aspect Meta Model) is largely based on a subset of the XML Schema Definition 1.1 (XSD, [xmlschema11-2]), including the types such as data ranges. In addition to types from XSD, the type langString is included as described in the RDF [rdf11] specification; it is used to represent strings with an explicit language tag. Using these types allows for example the distinction between a plain string and a dateTime string, unlike in JSON. The JSON data of a Property with a certain type uses the most convenient corresponding JSON type, i.e. booleans for XSD boolean, number for all numeric types, JSON object for Entities and string for everying else. The following figure shows the type hierarchy, in which arrows are interpreted as \"is a subtype of and can therefore be cast to\". The types anyType and anySimpleType are \"special\" types of the XSD type hierarchy and should not be directly used.

Any asset — it can be an actual physical asset like a drilling machine but also something virtual like a web service — has a digital representation with consistent semantics, called a Digital Twin. Digital Twins represent those assets and services and provide a shell for their Aspects which define the functionality the Digital Twin supports. Aspects provide the actual data of the Digital Twin that clients can use. Think of an Aspect as a live thing, i.e., a service that can be queried to retrieve current or aggregated data. The data can be anything from a single numeric value — e.g., a temperature sensor — to a complex block of data. Each Aspect references a concrete Aspect Model. This model describes in a formal, i.e., machine readable, format, how an Aspect is structured. The model describes for example the used physical unit and possible value range of the temperature sensor. Note that even in this simple example, a conventional approach could not satisfyingly answer the question of where this kind of information would otherwise live — in the sensor’s data sheet that is only a human-readable document? In the Aspect’s API documentation that is also only human-readable? Should the information about the sensor’s physical range be hard-coded in the Aspect and included in each service reply, even though it never changes? By expressing it in the Aspect Model, the Aspect’s semantics can be made available to consumers of the data in a way that opens up new possibilities. Therefore, an Aspect Model contains both information about runtime data structure (e.g., that there is a property in the data called \"temperature\", and that it has a numeric value) and information that is not part of the runtime data (e.g., the unit or range). It does not, however, contain actual runtime data (e.g., a numeric value representing the current temperature), as this will be delivered by an Aspect conforming to this Aspect Model. The combination of raw runtime data and its corresponding Aspect Model yields information. To specify an Aspect Model, the Semantic Aspect Meta Model (SAMM) is used. This document specifies the Semantic Aspect Meta Model. The Meta Model is specified using the Resource Description Format (RDF, [rdf11]) and the Terse RDF Triple Language syntax (TTL, [turtle]), together with validation rules in the Shapes Constraint Language (SHACL, [shacl]). Aspect Models are likewise specified in RDF/Turtle, following SAMM semantics.

To name a few examples, these generated artifacts may include generated source files in a well known programming language (like Java, JavaScript or Python), various visual representations of the model (SVG diagram of the model), nicely formatted documentation for the model (for example in an HTML format) or OpenAPI specification for accessing the data represented by the model programmatically. Some of this tooling may be limited in its own ways or impose its own restrictions on the size of the artifacts it can handle. Moreover, each of the target domains may impose different recommendations and best practices applicable to it. You will probably also want to include the generated artifacts in your CD/CI pipeline, where additional restrictions may apply. For example while in Java there is no restriction on the depth of an inheritance hierarchy, static code analysis tools in the build pipeline may impose one depending on the current ruleset in use. The general recommendations for sizing and using Aspect Models are: Start integrating all the required tooling as early in the lifecycle of your project as possible. This will for example help you to find out early rather than late if the corresponding payloads are too complex for aspect providers or consumers to efficiently handle.

The following diagram shows the basic building blocks: An Aspect is the root element of each Aspect Model and has a number of Properties, Events, and Operations. This element is mandatory and must appear exactly once per model. It has any number of Properties, Operations and Events ([0..n]). A Property represents a named value. This element is optional and can appear multiple times in a model ([0..n]). One Property has exactly one Characteristic. An Abstract Entity is a logical encapsulation of a shared concept. It has any number of Properties ([0..n]). An Abstract Entity can extend another Abstract Entity ([0..1]). This element is optional and can appear multiple times in a model ([0..n]). An Entity is a logical encapsulation of multiple values. It has any number of Properties ([0..n]). An Entity can extend either another Entity ([0..1]) or an Abstract Entity ([0..1]). This element is optional and can appear multiple times in a model ([0..n]). A Characteristic describes a Property’s meaning in the context of the Aspect with information such as its data type, if it is a collection, that a string value is to be interpreted as one of a fixed number of valid states or that a numeric value has an associated physical unit. This element is mandatory. It must appear once per Property. A Trait is used to add one or more constraints to a Characteristic ([1..n]), which is referred to as the \"base Characteristic\". A Constraint represents a limitation that is applied to a Characteristic (for example on the numeric value range or the maximum length of string). This element is optional and can appear multiple times per Characteristic ([0..n]). Characteristics, Constraints and element descriptions, are not part of the data an Aspect sends, but only exist in its model. A number of commonly used Characteristics and Constraints are predefined in the scope of the Semantic Aspect Meta Model, see section Characteristics for more information. An Operation represents an action that can be triggered on the Aspect. Depending on the Aspect, this can, but does not have to, trigger an action on the asset that is represented by the Digital Twin, for example switching a part of a machine on or off. This element is optional and can appear multiple times per Aspect ([0..n]). One Operation has any number of input Properties ([0..n]) and at most one output Property ([0..1]). An Event is a model element that represents a single occurence where the timing is important. Assets can for instance emit events to notify other assets in case of special occurences. This element is optional and can appear multiple times per Aspect ([0..n]). One Event has any number of parameter Properties ([0..n]). Quantifiable is the Characteristic that makes use of a Unit. Other Characteristics that are derived from Quantifiable have a Unit as well. A Unit refers to a physical unit, such as metre or degree celsius. A catalog of units are predefined in the scope of the Semantic Aspect Meta Model, see section Units for an in-depth description. A custom Unit can be added to a Characteristic, when the Characteristic is defined as Quantifiable class. It must appear exactly once per Quantifiable Characteristic. A Quantity Kind describes the kind a Unit refers to, such as length or temperature. This attribute is optional and can appear multiple times per Unit ([0..n]). See the sections Attributes that all model elements have and Declaring model elements in section Aspects for hints on using the model elements in an Aspect Model.","title":"Meta Model Elements","component":"samm-specification","version":"snapshot","name":"meta-model-elements","url":"/samm-specification/snapshot/meta-model-elements.html","titles":[]},"/samm-specification/snapshot/modeling-guidelines.html":{"text":"As mentioned in the Introduction, Aspect Models are described in RDF Turtle [turtle]. The aspect specification will therefore assume basic familiarity with Turtle. For the definition of the different Model elements please refer to the Meta Model Elements. The naming of Model Elements follows the naming Java naming conventions for classes, properties and methods. The names of Aspects, Entities, Events, Constraints and Characteristics follow the naming conventions for Java classes, i.e. UpperCamelCase. The names of Properties, Operations and Units follow the naming conventions of Java methods, i.e. lowerCamelCase. Each Aspect Model is defined in a separate TTL (Turtle) file. The Turtle file containing an Aspect Model must have the same name as the Aspect. Aspect Model files must be UTF-8 encoded and should not contain a byte order mark. There should be one empty line between model element definitions. Indentation should be done with three spaces. There should be a space before every separating semicolon. There should be padding spaces inside RDF lists and anonymous nodes (i.e. inside brackets and square brackets) Every model element (Aspects, Properties, Characteristics, Entities, Operations) has the following attributes: Attributes Description Required samm:preferredName Human readable name in a specific language. This attribute may be defined multiple times for different languages but only once for a specific language. There should be at least one preferredName defined with an \"en\" language tag. samm:description Human readable description in a specific language. This attribute may be defined multiple times for different languages but only once for a specific language. There should be at least one description defined with an \"en\" language tag. samm:see A reference to a related element in an external taxonomy, ontology or other standards document. The datatype is xsd:anyURI. This attribute may be defined multiple times. Although both samm:preferredName and samm:description should be set at least once in every model element, in the following examples we will mostly leave them out to improve readability. An Aspect Model file should start with the SAMM prefix definitions. The empty namespace \":\" should be used as local namespace, i.e. the versioned namespace in which the Aspect and its elements are defined. Other customer or domain specific namespaces can be defined additionally. However, the samm-* namespaces are reserved for the meta model. Third party locations can be referred via other namespaces (e.g., \"xsd:\"). See Namespaces and Versions for more details on the topic. @prefix : . @prefix samm: . @prefix samm-c: . @prefix samm-e: . @prefix unit: . @prefix xsd: . A Namespace defines the scope in which other model elements, including Aspects, are declared. Explicit declarations of Namespaces are not required, they exist implicitly by declaring model elements in them. However, the explicit declaration of a Namespace is useful if you want to assign human-readable names or descriptions to it. @prefix : urn:samm:com.mycompany.myapplication:1.0.0# . @prefix samm: . # The colon denotes the namespace as defined in the first @prefix declaration above. : a samm:Namespace ; samm:preferredName \"...\"@en ; samm:description \"...\"@en . An Aspect is defined by marking its identifier with a samm:Aspect and additional attributes. Note that the a is just a syntactic shortcut for rdf:type. In addition to the general attributes, every Aspect Model element has the following attributes: Attributes Description Required samm:properties The list of Properties of this Aspect. Leaving out this attribute completely is equivalent to having it present with an empty list as value. samm:operations The list of Operations of this Aspect. Leaving out this attribute completely is equivalent to having it present with an empty list as value. samm:events The list of Events of this Aspect. Aspects follow the naming conventions for Java classes, i.e. UpperCamelCase. Each Aspect Model must be defined in its own file. The file name must be the same as the Aspect’s name. The hierarchical namespace part in the Aspect’s URN can be freely chosen. The definition of an Aspect should therefore have the following structure in TTL syntax; note though that unused namespaces can be left out: @prefix : . @prefix samm: . @prefix samm-c: . @prefix samm-e: . @prefix unit: . @prefix xsd: . :MyAspect a samm:Aspect ; samm:preferredName \"My Aspect\"@en ; samm:preferredName \"Mein Aspekt\"@de ; samm:description \"This Aspect is an example.\"@en ; samm:description \"Dieser Aspekt ist ein Beispiel.\"@de ; samm:properties ( :myProperty :anotherProperty ) ; # In this example, there are no operations or events. samm:operations ( ) ; samm:events ( ) . In addition to the attributes that all model elements have, Properties have the following attributes: Attributes Description Required samm:characteristic The Characteristic describing this Property. samm:exampleValue An exemplary value the Property can take on that helps to understand the intended meaning of the property better. This can only be set for Properties with scalar data types (e.g., xsd:string or xsd:float, but not Entities). The data type of the samm:exampleValue must be convertible to the effective data type of the Property’s Characteristic. For example, if the Characteristic’s samm:dataType is xsd:int, xsd:short is also a valid type for the samm:exampleValue. Refer to section Implicit Conversions for more details. Example: :materialNumber a samm:Property ; samm:preferredName \"Material number\"@en ; samm:description \"A material number\"@en ; samm:exampleValue \"ABC123456-000\" ; samm:characteristic samm-c:Text . The attributes for Characteristics are described in detail in section Characteristics. The dataType attribute may be omitted when creating a subclass of a Characteristic. The dataType attribute must be set when creating an instance of a Characteristic, except when the dataType attribute has been set in the class or one of the super-classes. When the dataType has been set in a superclass, the dataType may be set to a subclass of the dataType from one of the Characteristic superclasses. This allows the definition of generic Characteristics such as Collections, where all the semantics are fixed, except for the data type. For a Collection for example it is possible to define whether the collection is sorted or not and this definition can be then reused with different data types to define different collections. Example: :MachineState a samm-c:State ; samm:dataType xsd:string ; samm-c:defaultValue \"STANDBY\" ; samm-c:values ( \"RUNNING\" \"STANDBY\" \"OFF\" ) . Whenever a Property represents a numeric, scalar value that the result of a measurent of some kind (e.g., using a sensor) and has a well-defined physical unit which is known at modeling time, use the Measurement Characteristic. If the value is numeric and has a physical unit but is not the result of a measurement (e.g., when it is calculated from other values), use the Quantifiable Characteristic. See the following example that uses Measurement — usage of Quantifiable is analogous. :ToolTemperature a samm-c:Measurement ; samm:dataType xsd:float ; samm-c:unit unit:degreeCelsius . :drillHeadTemperature a samm:Property ; samm:characteristic :ToolTemperature . See section Units for information about the valid values for the samm-c:unit attribute. The following example shows how a Property is defined that uses the Single Entity Characteristic to specify an Entity as its dataType. :AccelerationVector a samm:Entity ; samm:properties ( :x :y :z ) . # Definition of Properties x, y and z for the Entity here # ... :acceleration a samm:Property ; samm:characteristic [ a samm-c:SingleEntity ; samm:dataType :AccelerationVector ] . There are four basic predefined types of Collections: Collection, List, Set and Sorted Set. The Collection definitions are shared and are available globally. They determine whether a specific collection is ordered or not and whether a specific collection may contain duplicates or not. In some cases the data type is also set in the shared Collection Characteristic. These shared Collection Characteristics may not be changed in an Aspect Model, hence it is not allowed to create a subclass of the Collection Characteristic in an Aspect Model. To create a Collection Characteristic for a specific domain, the user should instantiate one of the Collection classes and define the data type or the element Characteristic for the Collection. In this example, the Characteristic resulting from the combination of Code, Length Constraint and Encoding Constraint is not defined inline in the Property, but defined standalone. Example with a scalar data type: :NumberList a samm-c:List ; samm:dataType xsd:float . Example with a custom Entity as data type: :MyEntity a samm:Entity ; samm:properties ( ) ; # ... . :MyEntityList a samm-c:List ; samm:dataType :MyEntity . The data type for the elements of a Collection can either be defined in the usual manner using the samm:dataType attribute (see the examples above) or by defining a Characteristic for the Collection elements using the samm-c:elementCharacteristic attribute, see the example below. It is recommended to explicitly create a Characteristic for the Collection elements instead of only defining the data type, since it allows to completely express the semantics of the elements. Example with the samm-c:elementCharacteristic attribute: :numbers a samm:Property ; samm:characteristic :NumberList . :NumberList a samm-c:List ; samm-c:elementCharacteristic [ a samm-c:Trait ; samm-c:baseCharacteristic :Number ; samm-c:constraint [ a samm-c:RangeConstraint ; samm:description \"Limits the range of the individual numbers in the list from 5 to 10.\"@en ; samm-c:minValue \"5\"^^xsd:nonNegativeInteger ; samm-c:maxValue \"10\"^^xsd:nonNegativeInteger ; ] ; ] . :Number a samm:Characteristic ; samm:dataType xsd:nonNegativeInteger . Describes a Property which may have a value from a predefined list of values. Also see Enumeration. Example with literal xsd:string values: :Status a samm-c:Enumeration ; samm:dataType xsd:string ; samm-c:values ( \"Complete\" \"In Progress\" \"Created\" ) . Example with literal xsd:integer values. Note that for xsd:integer, Turtle’s numeric literal syntax can be used: :PrimesBelowTwenty a samm-c:Enumeration ; samm:dataType xsd:integer ; samm-c:values ( 2 3 5 7 11 13 17 19 ) . Example with literal xsd:int values: :ValidOffsets a samm-c:Enumeration ; samm:dataType xsd:int ; samm-c:values ( \"-1\"^^xsd:int \"1\"^^xsd:int ) . Example with literal xsd:date values: :MaintenanceDates a samm-c:Enumeration ; samm:dataType xsd:date ; samm-c:values ( \"2010-01-01\"^^xsd:date \"2012-05-07\"^^xsd:date \"2018-03-08\"^^xsd:date ) . Example with complex values: Declaring an Enumeration with a complex value is usally done in order to add a description to the actual value, e.g., the state in the example below, which provides information regarding the meaning of the value. This description only exists in the Aspect Model and is not part of the payload provided by an Aspect at runtime. In order to define that a Property of an Entity is not part of the runtime data, the samm:notInPayload attribute is used. samm:notInPayload cannot be used in Abstract Entities, but the setting for a specific property is inherited when Entities are extended. :Results a samm-c:Enumeration ; samm:dataType :Result ; samm-c:values ( :Success :Failed ) . :Result a samm:Entity ; samm:properties ( :status [ samm:property :description; samm:notInPayload \"true\"^^xsd:boolean ] ) . :Success a :Result ; :status \"SUCCESS\" ; :description \"The process completed successfully.\" . :Failed a :Result ; :status \"FAILURE\" ; :description \"The process did not complete successfully.\" . If the Property is part of the runtime data (like status in the example), it is directly referenced. Writing samm:notInPayload false is not allowed. As described in State Characteristic, State inherits from Enumeration and extends it with the default value attribute. Example: :MachineState a samm-c:State ; samm:dataType xsd:string ; samm-c:defaultValue \"STANDBY\" ; samm-c:values ( \"RUNNING\" \"STANDBY\" \"OFF\" ) . The TimeSeries Characteristic is a special kind of Collection. A Time Series is defined as a list of tuples of values with their respective specific point in time when they where recorded. This is, the Time Series is represented by a list of key/value pairs where the key is the time-stamp denoting when the value was recorded and the value is the recorded value. In order to describe these semantics the shared TimeSeries Characteristic is used. This is a subclass of the SortedSet Characteristic and defines that the dataType must be a subclass of the TimeSeriesEntity. The TimeSeriesEntity is declared as an Abstract Entity. It defines the timestamp Property with the Timestamp Characteristic, which describes values containing timestamps conforming to xsd:dateTime, a date and time with or without time zone. It also defines value as an Abstract Property, i.e., a Property without a Characteristic. To create a Time Series for a specific domain, the user should instantiate the TimeSeries Collection Characteristic and set the dataType to an Entity which extends the Abstract TimeSeries Entity in order to define the semantics for the value Property in the context of the specific domain. Please see the Declaring Abstract Entities section for information on how to extend an Abstract Entity. Example: :MachineStateTimeSeries a samm-c:TimeSeries ; samm:dataType :MachineStateTimeSeriesEntity . :MachineStateTimeSeriesEntity a samm:Entity ; samm:extends samm-e:TimeSeriesEntity ; samm:properties ( :machineState ) . :machineState a samm:Property ; samm:characteristic :MachineState . :MachineState a samm-c:State ; samm:dataType xsd:string ; samm-c:defaultValue \"STANDBY\" ; samm-c:values ( \"RUNNING\" \"STANDBY\" \"OFF\" ) . An Aspect should only have one Collection at root level. When modeling an Aspect with two or more collections at root level which contain related data, consider creating the model so that the related data is explicitly linked and contained in a single Collection. When modeling an Aspect with two or more collections at root level which contain unrelated data, consider creating separate Aspects each containing a single Collection. Describes a Property whose value can have one of two possible types (a disjoint union). This Characteristic is special since it does not directly define a data type. The data type is defined in the two Characteristics which define the left and right value of the disjoint union. Also see Either and Payload mappings to JSON for Characteristics. Example: :speedProperty a samm:Property ; samm:characteristic :Result . :Result a samm-c:Either ; samm-c:left :ErrorMessage ; samm-c:right :SpeedValue . :ErrorMessage a samm-c:SingleEntity ; samm:dataType :ErrorEntity . :SpeedValue a samm-c:Quantifiable ; samm:dataType xsd:integer . :ErrorEntity a samm:Entity ; samm:properties ( :errorCode :errorDescription ) . Structured Values are intended to be used for Properties when all of the following conditions are met: The value has a scalar, string-like value space The value has a well-known structure consisting of different, separate parts The parts can and should be described in more detail The Property should not be decomposed/deconstructed into an Entity with separate Properties for each part One of the main use cases is complex identifiers that encode context information such as provenance information, version numbers, locations codes and so on. It is unreasonable to split such a value up into separate Properties, because it complicates working with corresponding data. For example, such values could appear in payloads, databases or documents and would have to be converted back and forth, often times manually. On the other hand, properly describing the value and the parts it comprises can be difficult, especially in a machine-readable way. Therefore, the Structured Value Characteristic can be used to describe the deconstruction of a value into its parts and linking each part to a separate Property definition. The following table gives some simple examples to demonstrate the basic applicability of the Characteristic, and after that a complete concrete example is given. Name Example Value Deconstruction Rule Elements ISO 8601 date \"2019-09-27\"^^xsd:date (\\d{4})-(\\d{2})-(\\d{2}) ( :year \"-\" :month \"-\" :day ) Email Address \"user4711@example.com\" ()@([\\w\\.-]\\.\\w{2,4}) ( :username \"@\" :host ) Hex-encoded color \"0xAC03BE\" 0x([0-9A-Fa-f]{2})([0-9A-Fa-f]{2})([0-9A-Fa-f]{2}) ( \"0x\" :red :green :blue ) The following code shows the Aspect Model for the first example from the table. Note that when writing the deconstructionRule, backslashes (\\) need to be escaped in order to produce valid RDF/Turtle syntax, i.e. write \\\\ instead of \\. :StructuredValueTest a samm:Aspect ; samm:properties ( :date ) ; samm:operations () . :date a samm:Property ; samm:exampleValue \"2019-09-27\"^^xsd:date ; samm:characteristic :StructuredDate . :StructuredDate a samm-c:StructuredValue ; samm:dataType xsd:date ; samm-c:deconstructionRule \"(\\\\d{4})-(\\\\d{2})-(\\\\d{2})\" ; samm-c:elements ( :year \"-\" :month \"-\" :day ) . :year a samm:Property ; samm:characteristic :Year . :month a samm:Property ; samm:characteristic :Month . :day a samm:Property ; samm:characteristic :Day . :Year a samm:Characteristic ; samm:dataType xsd:int . :Month a samm:Characteristic ; samm:dataType xsd:int . :Day a samm:Characteristic ; samm:dataType xsd:int . Technically, samm-c:elements would not be required just to parse corresponding payload; the regular expression given in the samm-c:deconstructionRule would be sufficient. However, the elements fields serves two purposes: Firstly, it concisely describes how the meaning of the deconstruction rule corresponds with the named fields; secondly, it is used for validation: When a samm:exampleValue is given (like in the example), the Aspect Model validator can automatically check if it can be deconstructed using the deconstruction rule and reconstructed using the elements, i.e., that the deconstruction rule actually does what the model author intended. The Reference Characteristic is intended to be used for scenarios where a reference to a concept external to the Aspect Model is required, but the value of the reference (i.e., the identifier of the linked concept) is not known at modeling time yet. Other than that, it is conceptually similar to a samm:see reference. :TestProperty a samm:Property ; samm:characteristic samm-c:Reference . As explained in the section Declaring Quantifiables and Measurements, some values only make sense when they also have a unit assigned to them. This unit definition is in many cases fixed at design time, does not change thereafter and therefore at runtime (in the JSON payload for example), only the actual value is transported. There may be scenarios, however, where this permanent fixation on a specific unit might not be sufficient because the unit can only be determined dynamically at runtime, or is a kind of configuration parameter which must be set when the system is being deployed/starting up. In cases like this, a UnitReference characteristic instance can be used to include a dynamic reference to the desired unit from the Unit catalog and this information is then always included in the payload. The runtime payload refers to the unit using its samm:curie, i.e., the unit’s URN’s element name prefixed with unit:. For example an Aspect with the following model: :ValueWithDynamicUnit a samm:Aspect ; samm:properties ( :value :unit ) ; samm:operations ( ) . :value a samm:Property ; samm:exampleValue \"2.25\"^^xsd:float ; samm:characteristic :FloatValue . :FloatValue a samm:Characteristic ; samm:dataType xsd:float . :unit a samm:Property ; samm:characteristic samm-c:UnitReference . can produce a JSON payload that could look something like this: { \"value\" : 2.25, \"unit\" : \"unit:hectopascal\" } Consider the numbers Property that uses an instance of the List Characteristic: :numbers a samm:Property ; samm:characteristic :NumberList . :NumberList a samm-c:List ; samm:dataType xsd:integer . To add a Length Constraint to the list, replace the use of the Characteristic with a new Trait instance. Set the original Characteristic as the Trait’s samm-c:baseCharacteristic and add the required Constraint as a samm-c:constraint to the Trait: :numbers a samm:Property ; samm:characteristic [ a samm-c:Trait ; samm-c:baseCharacteristic :NumberList ; samm-c:constraint [ a samm-c:LengthConstraint ; samm:description \"Limits the number list to 10 elements\"@en ; samm-c:maxValue \"10\"^^xsd:nonNegativeInteger ; ] ] . :NumberList a samm-c:List ; samm:dataType xsd:integer . Another more complex example is given below. The Property someIdentifier is defined that uses a Code instance using a dataType of xsd:string, combined with two Constraints: an Encoding Constraint that restricts the value space to US-ASCII and a Length Constraint that limits the string to 80 characters. :someIdentifier a samm:Property ; samm:preferredName \"Some identifier\"@en ; samm:description \"An ASCII-encoded identifier with a maximum length of 80 characters\"@en ; samm:characteristic :CodeWithLengthAndAscii . :CodeWithLengthAndAscii a samm-c:Trait ; samm:description \"A string code limited to 80 ASCII characters\"@en ; samm-c:baseCharacteristic [ a samm-c:Code ; samm:description \"Denotes some kind of code with a string datatype\"@en ; samm:dataType xsd:string ; ] ; samm-c:constraint [ a samm-c:EncodingConstraint ; samm:value samm:US-ASCII ; samm:description \"Limits the character encoding to US-ASCII\"@en ; ] ; samm-c:constraint [ a samm-c:LengthConstraint ; samm:description \"Limits the length to 80 characters\"@en ; samm-c:maxValue \"80\"^^xsd:nonNegativeInteger ; ] . An example showing the Regular Expression Constraint is given below: :timeStampsInJanuary a samm:Property ; samm:preferredName \"Timestamps in January\"@en ; samm:description \"Contains only timestamps in January of any year\"@en ; samm:characteristic [ a samm-c:Trait ; samm-c:baseCharacteristic samm-c:Timestamp ; samm-c:constraint [ a samm-c:RegularExpressionConstraint ; samm:value \"\\\\d{4}-01-\\\\d\\\\dT.*\" ; ] ; ] . When writing the samm:value, backslashes (\\) need to be escaped in order to produce valid RDF/Turtle syntax, i.e. write \\\\ instead of \\. Entities have the following attributes: Attributes Description Required samm:properties The list of Properties which make up the Entity. Leaving out this attribute completely is equivalent to having it present with an empty list as value. samm:extends The Entity which is extended by this Entity Example: :Error a samm:Entity ; samm:properties ( :errorCode :severity ) . Declaring that an Entity extends another Entity is done using the samm:extends attribute in the Entity declaration. Example: :Student a samm:Entity ; samm:extends :Person ; samm:properties ( :studentNumber ) . :Teacher a samm:Entity ; samm:extends :Person ; samm:properties ( :employeeNumber ) . :Person a samm:Entity ; samm:properties ( :name :surname ) . The extending Entities :Student and :Teacher contain the Properties declared in the extended Entity :Person as well as the Properties in their own declarations. The effective Property names, i.e. the payload name when samm:payloadName is used, or the name of the Property, must be unique across the entire Entity inheritance chain. Otherwise the corresponding runtime payload is ambiguous. When one of the attributes samm:payloadName, samm:optional or samm:notInPayload is used on a specific property usage, its value is also inherited by the extending Entities. Using the example of samm:payloadName, we could modify the above example to enforce the alternative naming for the surname property in the generated payloads and this change would apply to the Person Entity (directly) and both Student and Teacher Entities (via inheritance): :Person a samm:Entity ; samm:properties ( :name [ samm:property :surname ; samm:payloadName \"familyName\" ] ) . In contrast to Entities, Abstract Entities cannot directly be instantiated. A Characteristic class may have a type samm:entity or samm:AbstractEntity. But a Characteristic instance cannot have a type samm:AbstractEntity. If there is an instance created from a Characteristic that uses an Abstract Entity as its type, this Characteristic instance’s dataType must be a sub-Entity of the Abstract Entity. The main use case for Abstract Entities is to share Properties across multiple Entities. This can be achieved through inheritance: Abstract Entities can extend other Entities and Abstract Entities and can themselves be extended in a manner not dissimilar to how abstract classes are used in many programming languages. In the following example, both SteeringWheel and Seat extend the Abstract Entity VehicleComponent. Both inherit the typeNumber and the manufacturer Properties: :VehicleComponent a samm:AbstractEntity ; samm:properties ( :typeNumber :manufacturer ) . :Steeringwheel a samm:Entity ; samm:extends :VehicleComponent ; samm:properties ( :isMultifunction ) . :Seat a samm:Entity ; samm:extends :VehicleComponent ; samm:properties ( :material ) . When an Abstract Entity needs to be defined with a certain Property, but the modeler using the Abstract Entity (i.e., extending it) should be able to decide the Property’s Characteristic, the Property can be declared a samm:AbstractProperty. An Abstract Property is similar to a Property, with two differences: firstly, it has no samm:Characteristic attribute and secondly, it must only be used in Abstract Entities. Consider the following example of two-dimensional vector which is declared as an Abstract Entity using two Abstract Properties for its x and y values, leaving for the user to decide which Characteristic and hence which data type should be used: :Vec2 a samm:AbstractEntity ; samm:description \"A two-dimensional vector\"@en ; samm:properties ( :x :y ) . :x a samm:AbstractProperty ; samm:description \"The x part of the vector\"@en . :y a samm:AbstractProperty ; samm:description \"The y part of the vector\"@en . The usage of the Abstract Properties allows to specify the contract (a two-dimensional vector must have x and y Properties), but allows flexible reuse. Only when it is used, one must decide on the Characteristic and with it its effective datatype such as xsd:int, xsd:float or xsd:decimal. To use the Vec2 Abstract Entity, the Characteristic to bind to the Abstract Properties is declared and then used as follows: :IntegerNumber a samm:Characteristic ; samm:dataType xsd:integer . :IntVec2 a samm:Entity ; samm:extends :Vec2 ; samm:properties ( [ samm:extends :x ; samm:characteristic :IntegerNumber ] [ samm:extends :y ; samm:characteristic :IntegerNumber ] ) . Note that an Abstract Entity can have both samm:Property​s and samm:AbstractProperty​s (both are listed in samm:properties). The properties list of an Entity that extends the Abstract Entity must specify the Characteristic to use for each of the Abstract Properties (and only those). Operations have the following attributes: Attributes Description Required samm:input A list of references to Properties that describe the input to the operation. The attribute must be present, but the list may be empty. samm:output A single reference to a Property that describes the output of the operation. Example: :toggle a samm:Operation ; samm:preferredName \"Toggle\"@en ; samm:description \"Switches the device on or off\"@en ; samm:input ( :toggleArgument ) ; samm:output :toggleResult . :toggleArgument a samm:Property ; samm:preferredName \"Toggle argument\"@en ; samm:description \"The argument for the toggling operation\"@en ; samm:characteristic :ToggleValues . :ToggleValues a samm-c:Enumeration ; samm:preferredName \"Toggle values\"@en ; samm:description \"The possible input values for the toggle operation\"@en ; samm:dataType xsd:string ; samm-c:values ( \"on\" \"off\" ) . :toggleResult a samm:Property ; samm:preferredName \"Toggle result\"@en ; samm:description \"The result of the toggle operation\"@en ; samm:characteristic :ToggleResult . :ToggleResult a samm-c:Enumeration ; samm:preferredName \"Toggle result\"@en ; samm:description \"The possible results of the toggle operation\"@en ; samm:dataType xsd:string ; samm-c:values ( \"ok\" \"denied\" \"unknown\" ) . Events have the following attributes: Attributes Description Required samm:parameters The parameters that describe the Event, given as a list of Properties. Example: :temperatureUpdated a samm:Event ; samm:parameters ( :drillHeadTemperature ) . :ToolTemperature a samm-c:Measurement ; samm:dataType xsd:float ; samm-c:unit unit:degreeCelsius . :drillHeadTemperature a samm:Property ; samm:characteristic :ToolTemperature . The samm:see attribute can be used to add references to related elements in an external taxonomy, ontology or standards document to Aspect Model elements. Values for samm:see must be URIs. The meaning of the reference is informative and implies no semantics such as equality or subsumption in either direction. In the following example, samm:see adds two references to external well-known vocabularies that have identifiers which are also valid URLs: :lastName a samm:Property ; samm:see ; samm:see ; samm:characteristic samm-c:Text . If an external model element should be referenced that has a unique identifier which is not a URI, but a well-known resolver exists, you can either use the resolver’s URL or a synthetic URN. For example, for the Digital Object Identifier (DOI, [DOI]) 10.1109/NetSys.2017.7903949, you can use as the value for samm:see either the URL https://doi.org/10.1109/NetSys.2017.7903949 or the URN urn:doi:10.1109/NetSys.2017.7903949. If an external model element should be referenced that has a unique identifier which is not a URI and there is no well-known resolver, use a synthetic URN structure. One example are Object Identifiers as specified by ITU and ISO/IEC (OID) and the mapping to URNs in RFC 3061 [rfc3061], so for example, for the OID 1.3.6.1.4.1.1919.1.1.2, the corresponding samm:see value would be urn:oid:1.3.6.1.4.1.1919.1.1.2: :filterName a samm:Property ; samm:see ; samm:characteristic samm-c:Text . If an external element should be referenced that has no unique identifier, samm:see should not be used. In this case, refer to the external element in the current model element’s samm:description, for example: :organizationPerson a samm:Property ; samm:description \"See ISO/IEC 11179-6:2015(E), section 3.35\"@en ; samm:characteristic samm-c:Text . When Properties are used in Aspects and Entities, they can be marked as optional (not possible for properties of Abstract Entities). This means that a Property’s usage is optional, not the Property itself, which would make reusing a Property more difficult. In the following example, the Property toggleStatus is mandatory and the Property errorMessage is marked as optional in the Aspect. Note how the samm:properties of the Aspect are defined, and how the definition for the toggleStatus Property itself does not differ from that of errorMessage. @prefix : . @prefix samm: . @prefix samm-c: . @prefix xsd: . :MyAspect a samm:Aspect ; samm:properties ( :toggleStatus [ samm:property :errorMessage; samm:optional true ] ) ; samm:operations ( ) . :toggleStatus a samm:Property ; samm:characteristic samm-c:Boolean . :errorMessage a samm:Property ; samm:characteristic samm-c:Text . If the Property’s use is optional, it is marked with samm:optional true (like errorMessage in the example). However, if its use is mandatory (like toggleStatus in the example), the Property is directly referenced. Writing samm:optional false is not allowed. The setting of the samm:optional attribute for a specific property is inherited from parent Entity by the Entities extending it using the Entity extension mechanism (samm:extends). When Properties are used in Aspects and Entities, a runtime payload name can be defined for the Property. This means that in the context of the Aspect or Entity (payload names cannot be defined for Abstract Entities) where the Property is used, the key of that Property in the runtime payload diverges from the Property’s local name. This allows for the separation of the semantic name of the Property and the corresponding key in the runtime payload. In the following example we define a Property errorMessage. In the Aspect it is defined that the corresponding key in the payload is error. The value for the samm:payloadName attribute must be of type xsd:string. @prefix : . @prefix samm: . @prefix samm-c: . @prefix xsd: . :MyAspect a samm:Aspect ; samm:properties ( [ samm:property :errorMessage; samm:payloadName \"error\" ] ) ; samm:operations ( ) . :errorMessage a samm:Property ; samm:characteristic samm-c:Text . A Property must not be marked as not being included in the payload using samm:notInPayload true and have a payload name declared using samm:payloadName. It is also useful to know that the payload name definition is inherited from parent Entity by its children when using the Entity extension mechanism (samm:extends). When Properties use Characteristics classes, i.e. Characteristics that need to be instantiated, and the Characteristic instance is used in only one Property, the Characteristic may also be defined inline. Note that other Aspect Models can not refer to the Characteristic any more, because it no longer has an identifier. Example: Regular definition of a Property :numbers a samm:Property ; samm:characteristic :NumberList . :NumberList a samm-c:List ; samm:dataType xsd:integer . Example: Inlining the Characteristic definition :numbers a samm:Property ; samm:characteristic [ a samm-c:List; samm:dataType xsd:integer ] . To understand the possibilities for localization of the models and their implications it is important to understand the differences between the data types xsd:string and rdf:langString and/or their respective characteristic counterparts samm-c:Text and samm-c:MultiLanguageText. To illustrate the differences between them and to give a typical example for localizable string that also needs to be included in the runtime payload, consider this model with a scalar text property: :Test a samm:Aspect; samm:properties ( :text ); samm:operations ( ). :text a samm:Property ; samm:characteristic samm-c:Text . The JSON payload for this model would then look like this: { \"text\" : \"My value\" } Notice how the text is just a raw string, without any information about the language it is written in. When instead the text property is modeled as samm-c:MultiLanguageText (instead of samm-c:Text), the payload would change to include the information about the language and would look like this: { \"text\" : { \"en\" : \"Example multi language string\" } } Another common use case is the use of localized texts strictly for documentation purposes. This means that the multilanguage strings can only be seen when modeling, they are not contained in the runtime payloads. To illustrate how this is done, consider this example and imagine we would like the descriptions of the possible enumeration values to have localized version of the texts. This goal could be achieved by extending the model to look something like the following example: :Results a samm-c:Enumeration ; samm:dataType :Result ; samm-c:values ( :Success :Failed ) . :Result a samm:Entity ; samm:properties ( :status [ samm:property :description ; samm:notInPayload true ] ) . :status a samm:Property ; samm:characteristic samm-c:Text . :description a samm:Property ; samm:characteristic samm-c:MultiLanguageText . :Success a :Result ; :status \"SUCCESS\" ; :description \"Der Prozess war erfolgreich.\"@de . :Failed a :Result ; :status \"FAILURE\" ; :description \"Der Prozess ist fehlgeschlagen.\"@de . Note the use of the attribute notInPayload in usage of the property, ensuring that the description property will never be included in the runtime payloads.

A Property’s effective data type means the Property’s Characteristic’s samm:dataType. A data type is scalar, if it is one of the allowed data types, but not a samm:Entity. In order to create JSON payloads that correspond to an Aspect Model, the following rules are applied. The other way round they can also be used to describe a validation algorithm. An Aspect Model is always serialized as an unnamed JSON object. For each Property: If it is marked as optional, it may or may not be included in the payload. If, and only if, the Property is marked as optional and is included in the payload, then its value may be null, which is equivalent to it not being included in the payload. If the Property’s effective data type is scalar with any date type other than rdf:langString, the Property is serialized as ${propertyName}: ${value} where ${value} is the JSON serialization of the respective Property’s value, details on mapping of the data types are given in Data type mappings. The value must adhere to the value range defined by the Property’s effective data type and possible Constraints on the Property’s Characteristic. If the Property’s effective data type is scalar with the data type rdf:langString, the Property is serialized as a named JSON object (with ${propertyName} being the name of the JSON property), with keys for each available language tag of the Property and the corresponding localized string as the value. If the Property’s effective data type is not scalar, it is serialized as a named JSON object (with ${propertyName} being the name of the JSON property), recursively using the same rules. If the Property’s effective data type is an Entity which extends another Entity, it is serialized as a named JSON object (with ${propertyName} being the name of the JSON property). The Properties included for the Entity, are the Properties from the Entity itself as well as all Properties from the extended Entities, i.e. all Properties from ?thisEntity samm:extends* []. If the Property’s Characteristic is a Collection, List, Set or Sorted Set, it is serialized as a named JSON array (with ${propertyName} being the name of the JSON array property). Characteristics defined in the Aspect Model other than the ones mentioned above are not subject to serialization. Operations defined in the Aspect Model are not subject to serialization. Events defined in the Aspect Model are not subject to serialization. @prefix : . @prefix samm: . @prefix samm-c: . @prefix samm-e: . @prefix unit: . @prefix xsd: . :Movement a samm:Aspect ; samm:preferredName \"movement\"@en ; samm:properties ( :isMoving :speed ) ; samm:operations ( ) ; samm:events ( ) . :isMoving a samm:Property ; samm:preferredName \"is moving\"@en ; samm:characteristic samm-c:Boolean . :speed a samm:Property ; samm:preferredName \"speed\"@en ; samm:characteristic :Speed ; samm:exampleValue \"0.5\"^^xsd:float . :Speed a samm-c:Measurement ; samm:preferredName \"speed\"@en ; samm:dataType xsd:float ; samm-c:unit unit:kilometrePerHour . { \"isMoving\": true, \"speed\": 0.5 } A rich type tree is used in an Aspect Model. As JSON offers only a very limited set of data types for primitive type values there are less options on how to represent the data. The mappings are described in the following table. Aspect Model data type Corresponding JSON data type Core Types xsd:string String xsd:boolean Boolean xsd:decimal Number xsd:integer Number IEEE-floating-point numbers xsd:double Number xsd:float Number Time and date xsd:date String xsd:time String xsd:dateTime String xsd:dateTimeStamp String Recurring and partial dates xsd:gYear String xsd:gMonth String xsd:gDay String xsd:gYearMonth String xsd:gMonthDay String xsd:duration String xsd:yearMonthDuration String xsd:dayTimeDuration String Limited-range integer numbers xsd:byte Number xsd:short Number xsd:int Number xsd:long Number xsd:unsignedByte Number xsd:unsignedShort Number xsd:unsignedInt Number xsd:unsignedLong Number xsd:positiveInteger Number xsd:nonNegativeInteger Number xsd:negativeInteger Number xsd:nonPositiveInteger Number Encoded binary data xsd:hexBinary String xsd:base64Binary String Miscellaneous types xsd:anyURI String samm:curie String rdf:langString A JSON object with a structure as described in the rules above. For example, a Property errorMessage with effective data type rdf:langString and the value \"Could not load data\"@en would be serialized in the JSON payload as follows: { \"errorMessage\": { \"en\": \"Could not load data\" } } A Property errorMessages with a Collection Characteristic and effective data type rdf:langString could yield the payload: { \"errorMessages\": [ { \"en\": \"Could not load data\" }, { \"de\": \"Konnte Daten nicht laden\" } ] } This section describes how data payloads look like for specific Characteristics. Characteristic Name Corresponding JSON data type samm-c:Either A JSON object with exactly either a left or right key. If the left key is present, its data type is the effective data type of the Characteristic referred to by samm-c:left; if the right key is present, its data type is the effective data type of the Characteristic referred to by samm-c:right. The following example Aspect uses samm-c:Either to express that the Property speedValue can either return the integer value for speed, or an Error message (using an Entity), if the value could not be determined (cf. Declaring Either). So, assuming an Aspect Model has a Property speedProperty with its samm:characteristic set to :Result according to the following definition: :speedProperty a samm:Property ; samm:characteristic :Result . :Result a samm-c:Either ; samm-c:left :ErrorMessage ; samm-c:right :SpeedValue . :ErrorMessage a samm-c:SingleEntity ; samm:dataType :ErrorEntity . :SpeedValue a samm-c:Quantifiable ; samm:dataType xsd:integer . :ErrorEntity a samm:Entity ; samm:properties ( :errorCode :errorDescription ) . the corresponding JSON payload either contains a left key with the error description: { \"result\": { \"left\": { \"errorCode\": \"...\", \"errorDescription\": \"...\" } } } or it can contain a right key with the success status: { \"result\": { \"right\": { \"status\": \"...\" } } } In the following example the Property speedProperty can either return the integer value for speed SpeedValue, or an Error, if the value could not be determined. Error can either return the samm-c:Text with simple error text or ErrorMessage (using an Entity) for details of error like errorCode and errorDescription. So, assuming the Property speedProperty with samm-characteristics set to :Result according to the following definition: :speedProperty a samm:Property ; samm:characteristic :Result . :Result a samm-c:Either ; samm:description \"The result is either an error or a SpeedValue\"@en ; samm-c:left :Error ; samm-c:right :SpeedValue . :Error a samm-c:Either ; samm:description \"\"\"An error can be either a simple text, or a complex object with separate errorCode and errorDescription\"\"\"@en ; samm-c:left samm-c:Text ; samm-c:right :ErrorMessage . :SpeedValue a samm-c:Quantifiable ; samm:dataType xsd:integer . :ErrorMessage a samm:Characteristic ; samm:dataType :ErrorEntity . :ErrorEntity a samm:Entity ; samm:properties ( :errorCode :errorDescription ) . :errorCode a samm:Property ; samm:characteristic samm-c:Text . :errorDescription a samm:Property ; samm:characteristic samm-c:Text . it can contain right key with the speed value: { \"speedProperty\": { \"right\": 60 } } or possible left key of Error contains Error message: { \"speedProperty\" : { \"left\" : { \"right\" : { \"errorDescription\" : \"...\", \"errorCode\" : \"...\" } } } } or it can contain right key of Error with simple error text: { \"speedProperty\" : { \"left\" : { \"left\" : \"Simple error description...\" } } } If the model is invalid, it might be impossible to build a JSON payload that corresponds to the model. For example, if a Set of xsd:boolean values has a Length Constraint of samm-c:minValue 3, no valid payload can be constructed. Due to the limits in the represention of numbers in JSON, the maximum integer number that can be used without losing precision is 2⁵³-1 (defined as Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER). This means that even if the Aspect Model data type would allow higher or lower values, if they can not be represented in JSON, they can not be used. Affected data types are the unbounded numeric types xsd:decimal, xsd:integer, xsd:positiveInteger, xsd:nonNegativeInteger, xsd:negativeInteger, xsd:nonPositiveInteger and the bounded type xsd:unsignedLong. The other numeric types are not affected.","title":"Mapping to JSON","component":"samm-specification","version":"snapshot","name":"payloads","url":"/samm-specification/snapshot/payloads.html","titles":[{"text":"Rules for the construction of JSON payloads matching an Aspect Model","id":"rules-for-the-construction-of-json-payloads-matching-an-aspect-model"},{"text":"Example","id":"example"},{"text":"Aspect Model","id":"aspect-model"},{"text":"Payload","id":"payload"},{"text":"Data type mappings","id":"data-type-mappings"},{"text":"Specific payload mappings for Characteristics","id":"characteristics-payload-mappings"},{"text":"Limitations","id":"limitations"}]},"/samm-specification/snapshot/units.html":{"text":"A catalog of physical units and quantity kinds (\"length\" would be the quantity kind for the units \"metre\", \"inch\", \"millimetre\" and so on) is part of the Aspect Meta Model.

Seemingly obvious abbreviations can be misunderstood in different contexts. For example, \"temp\" could mean \"temperature\" or \"temporary\". On the other hand, abbreviating \"minimum\" and \"maximum\" with \"min\" and \"max\", respectively, is fine. The Aspect Model should be reasonably expressive. Do not add alleged premature optimizations that belong in the Aspect implementation: if you think a Property is name expressive but too long for the runtime payload, consider adding a payload name to the Property’s usage instead of renaming the Property. Do not use redundant naming parts. In particular, the name of an Aspect should not end with \"Aspect\". It is however fine to distinguish between e.g. an Entity and a related Characteristic by a suffix when necessary. Do not use redundant prefixes, e.g. when authoring an Aspect Model for the domain Foo, do not name your Properties fooCount, fooId etc. Remember that the full identifier of a Property is the versioned namespace concatenated with the element name, e.g. urn:samm:com.mycompany.myapplication:1.0.0#count, so the context is already part of count​'s identifier. The attributes preferredName and description are meant to provide a human-readable name and description, respectively, for example for the generation of documentation from the Aspect Model. If you copy and paste the element’s name to the preferredName, make sure to adjust it: Make the name upper case If the name consists of more than one word (i.e., camelCase), turn it into two words, e.g. the name machineTemperature should become the preferredName Machine Temperature. If there is exactly one Property in an Aspect that has a Collection, List, Set, Sorted Set or Time Series Characteristic (and no other Properties), the Property should be named items. If there is exactly one Property in an Aspect that has a Collection, List, Set or Sorted Set Characteristic (and no other Properties), the Aspect’s name should be in plural. Otherwise, if there is exactly one Property in the Aspect that has a Time Series Characteristic, the Aspect’s name should end with \"History\". Otherwise, the Aspect’s name should be in singular. While JSON only distinguishes between number (floating point) and integer, the type hierarchy for Aspect Models provides many more options. There is a distinction between the numeric core types (xsd:integer and the fixed-point type xsd:decimal) and the limited range numbers that correspond to the numeric types as defined in most programming languages (xsd:float and xsd:double as well as the integer types xsd:int, xsd:short etc.). As an Aspect Model ideally captures as much of the domain semantics as possible, it should not limit itself according to implementation-specific restrictions. In particular, limited range numbers should only be used when the semantics of the numeric range are relevant beyond the implementation of the Aspect. For example, a Property temperature of a sensor could use a limited range type such as xsd:int, when the physical sensor can never provide a value outside of this range, while a Property such as numberOfProducedItems is not logically limited, so it should use xsd:integer. When trying to refer to a physical unit, please see the Unit Catalog. When searching for the unit, remember that the unit catalog uses British English, e.g., metre instead of meter. If you’re modeling quantities for which both the metric system and the imperial system provide units, such as meter vs feet, it is always recommended to use the metric system (preferably SI units like meter or others like kilometer if more common in the domain) – unless there are specific reasons to create the model differently. In any case it is strongly discouraged to add multiple Properties in the same scope representing the same value only using different units due to the inherent complexity. The following decision tree helps finding the right Characteristic for a Property. A common error is using the Text Characteristic for anything resembling a string. Text is intended for values that are meant only for humans, for example a description of a device that is entered by a user as free text. Values such as identifiers, hostnames, table names, license plate numbers etc. should not use the Text Characteristic. If you create Characteristics that are not limited to your modeled domain but are generally useful, please consider contributing them, so that they can be included in the Semantic Aspect Meta Model’s Characteristic catalog. Constraints are used to precisely specify limiting conditions of Characteristics. It is recommended to use Constraints thoroughly: It makes the intent of the respective Property clear for humans reading the model or documentation generated from the model It allows tooling to generate code for the Aspect that can take the Constraints into account. Validation code corresponding to the Constraints can be directly inserted, thus reducing manual implementation effort. The following decision tree helps finding matching Constraints for a Characteristic. Note that multiple Constraints can be combined. If and only if the value has a string-like value space and does not use UTF-8 as an encoding, use an Encoding Constraint for the Property. This will ensure that consumers of the Aspect will not end up with broken special characters. It is generally advisable to reuse definitions of existing model elements that describe the desired semantics. This not only ensures efficiency and maintainability, but more importantly, it explicitly expresses that the model builds upon a set of agreed-upon abstractions. Reuse of exising model element definitions makes it clear that your model talks about the same thing. On the other hand, introducing another definition of an allegedly already existing concept is equivalent to stating that the deliberately newly created definition does indeed mean something different. This is particularly useful when model elements are created for terminology that can have many different meanings in various contexts, such as the term \"process\". Entities, Characteristics, Events, Constraints and Properties are fundamental components of an Aspect. Reusing these elements across different Aspects ensures consistency, reduces redundancy, and simplifies the management and integration of shared attributes and interactions.","title":"Best Practices","component":"samm-specification","version":"snapshot","name":"best-practices","url":"/samm-specification/snapshot/appendix/best-practices.html","titles":[{"text":"Naming Elements","id":"naming-elements"},{"text":"Choosing a Numeric Type","id":"choosing-a-numeric-type"},{"text":"Choosing a Unit","id":"choosing-a-unit"},{"text":"Choosing a Characteristic","id":"choosing-a-characteristic"},{"text":"Choosing Constraints","id":"choosing-constraints"},{"text":"Reuse Elements","id":"reuse-elements"}]},"/samm-specification/snapshot/appendix/bibliography.html":{"text":"[rec20] UN Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) Recommendation 20 — Codes for Units of Measure Used in International Trade.

Authoring an Aspect Model is comparable to the creation of a software artifact. At first, a domain model draft or concept map is created to capture the understanding of the respective domain experts (cf. domain-driven design), which is then formalized into an actual Aspect Model. After multiple iterations, each of which improves the modeled concepts and the overall quality of the model, a first \"complete\" version is created. This first version might contain the minimal subset of relevant Properties complete with correct Characteristics and proper descriptions. This \"Version 1.0\" of the model can then be used to implement the first version of the corresponding Aspect. Imagine that the service is running and delivers data that corresponds to the \"Version 1.0\" of the Aspect Model. Clients are developed as well, possibly by different parties, and happily consume the Aspect data. However, sooner or later there will be a need for change in the Aspect Model. For example, it could be missing relevant Properties, existing Properties could use wrong Characteristics, descriptions or names, or could be missing localizations. This can happen for many reasons: The modelled device or asset changes, Clients find that they need certain pieces of data that were originally deemed unimportant and thus excluded from the Aspect Model, or that should have a different structure, In the original model, something was modelled in the wrong way, As part of the natural evolution of the model when the initial minimal subset of Properties is expanded to a comprehensive description of the domain, etc. It is to be expected that an Aspect Model is continually improved upon (to a certain point, when it is considered \"finished\"). The model maintainers can change the Aspect Model as they see fit and release a new version. But what happens with the running Aspects and clients? Do all of them have to be changed immediately every time? The first measure towards a graceful evolution of Aspect Models in a living system (i.e., the models don’t live in a vacuum but are actually used by Aspects and Clients) is the decoupling of models and payload. In the section that describes the mapping of Aspect models to corresponding JSON payloads, you can see that the JSON payloads have no indication of the Aspect Model that describes them. In particular, they do not contain a reference to the URN of the corresponding Aspect Model. This is similar to how the structure of a JSON document can be validated against a JSON Schema.[1] Therefore there are changes that can be made in the Aspect Model so that the structure of the corresponding JSON payload does not change. We will call this type of changes safe changes. When a new version of an Aspect Model is released that contains only safe changes and a corresponding Aspect delivers only data that is valid in regards to the new version of the Aspect Model, the data is also still valid in regards to the previous version of the Aspect Model. The Aspect can therefore still be used by clients built using the previous version without having to be changed. At the place used to look up the Aspect, the previous version of the Aspect Model and the updated version can and should both be associated simultaneously with the same Aspect endpoint. This allows clients that only understand the previous version of the Aspect Model to still consume data from the Aspect (although they do not benefit from the updates introduced in the new model version), while clients that are updated to use the new Aspect Model can benefit from the update. At some point, older versions of the model can be removed from the Aspect. However, the exact conditions of when this can be done depend heavily on the concrete use case and are therefore out of scope of this document. Every change to the Aspect Model that is backwards compatible in the sense that it permits all previously permitted JSON payloads and keeps semantics (see below) is a safe change. The following table gives an overview of the safe and unchanges that mainly concern the structure of the data. Safe Changes Unsafe Changes Adding, removing or changing attributes that are never part of payloads, e.g., samm:preferredName, samm:description and samm:see Adding a new Property Making a mandatory Property optional Changing a data type a to type b when a can be cast to b Removing values from an Enumeration Renaming an existing Property Making an optional Property mandatory Changing a data type a to type b when a can not be cast to b Adding values to an Enumeration Changing values in an Enumeration Deciding whether a change to a Characteristic is safe depends on the change itself. Basically, a change that adds restrictions on the value range is safe, while removing restrictions is unsafe, if and only if the effective value range was equivalent in the first place. For example, adding a Regular Expression Constraint that restricts values on a Text Characteristic is safe, because an Aspect that delivers data which is valid for both the previous version of the Aspect Model (without the Constraint) and for the new version (with the Constraint) will only ever deliver data that clients using the previous version of the Aspect Model can understand. Adding the constraint in the model just makes the previous implicit assumption explicit and visible. If the Constraint on the other hand signifies an actual change, i.e., values that were previously valid are no longer valid in the new version, this is an unsafe change. If the value range is effectively the same and has the same meaning, for example by replacing a Regular Expression Expression on a Text Characteristic with an Enumeration that has the same values as those that would be parsed by the Regular Expression, or vice versa, this is a safe change as well. Changes such as this can be made when an Aspect Model is refactored to be better readable or understandable. Another example is changing a Characteristic with a string-like value space into a Structured Value: The payload does not change, but the meaning is specified in greater detail by describing all logical parts of the value. If the value range is effectively the same but the meaning is different, this is not considered a safe change, because the domain semantics captured by the Aspect Model are not the same. For example, if the unit of a Measurement Characteristic is changed from unit:metre to unit:inch but both versions use xsd:int as a data type, values have obviously different meanings. This means that a specific Aspect endpoint using this Aspect Model must not be associated with both versions of the Aspect Model simultaneously. Of course, the Aspect can implement both versions and make them available on different endpoints. When only safe changes are made to the Aspect Model, the model author can choose between increasing the MINOR part of the version (e.g. from 1.0.0 to 1.1.0) or the PATCH part of the version (e.g. from 1.0.0 to 1.0.1). Otherwise, the model author can choose between increasing the MINOR part or the MAJOR part of the version (e.g. from 1.0.0 to 2.0.0). The latter change should be used to indicate structural and semantic incompatibility between versions. Let’s consider a simple Aspect Model MachineOnlineStatus that describes a Property onlineStatus which represents the information about whether a machine is online, offline, starting up or undefined (if the current status can not be retrieved). @prefix : . @prefix samm: . @prefix xsd: . :MachineOnlineStatus a samm:Aspect ; samm:properties ( :machineOnlineStatus ) ; samm:operations ( ) . :machineOnlineStatus a samm:Property ; samm:description \"The current machine online status. Can be either ON, OFF, BOOTING or UNDEFINED.\"@en ; samm:characteristic [ (1) a samm:Characteristic ; samm:dataType xsd:string ] . In version 1.0.0 of the model, the modeler decides to first represent the Property itself using an OnlineStatus Characteristic ①. They use the string datatype to be able to represent the four valid states given in the target machine’s data sheet. @prefix : . @prefix samm: . @prefix samm-c: . @prefix xsd: . :MachineOnlineStatus a samm:Aspect ; samm:properties ( :machineOnlineStatus ) ; samm:operations ( ) . :machineOnlineStatus a samm:Property ; samm:description \"The current machine online status.\"@en ; samm:characteristic [ a samm-c:Enumeration ; (2) samm:dataType xsd:string ; samm-c:values ( \"ON\" \"OFF\" \"BOOTING\" \"UNDEFINED\" ) ] . The modeler decides to reify the possible status values by using an Enumeration as the characteristic ②. Because the Property still has the string datatype, payloads for the previous and the current model version do not differ. Taking into account that the description in the previous model version states the valid values and they do not differ to the Enumeration’s values, this makes the change a safe change. Therefore, the Aspect Model’s version is increased to 1.0.1. @prefix : . @prefix samm: . @prefix samm-c: . @prefix xsd: . :MachineOnlineStatus a samm:Aspect ; samm:properties ( :machineOnlineStatus ) ; samm:operations ( ) . :machineOnlineStatus a samm:Property ; samm:description \"The current machine online status.\"@en ; samm:characteristic [ a samm-c:Enumeration ; samm:dataType xsd:string ; samm-c:values ( \"ON\" \"OFF\" \"BOOTING\" ) (3) ] . By carefully reading the machine’s data sheet, the modeler determined that the UNKNOWN online status can only ever occur before some machine-internal controller is initialized, which only occurs during booting the device. Thus, they remove the UNKNOWN status from the enumeration ③, because BOOTING can always be used in its place. This results in the following points: The status that is confusing to users and downstream developers is removed. The model more clearly states its purpose. By removing the machine-specific idiosyncrasy, the model is more generally applicable and can be used with other devices as well. The implementation of the Aspect can no longer just pass-through the value read from the device but has to clean up the value. In this case this is trivial, but in more complex scenarios this might require according complex logic. However, it is always preferable to perform data clean up in the Aspect and therefore present an interface via the Aspect Model that is as \"clean\" as possible. Removal of the UNKNOWN status is a safe change: Clients that can deal with the previous status set, can also deal with the sub-set that does not include UNKNOWN. For this reason, the version is increased to 1.0.2. @prefix : . @prefix samm: . @prefix samm-c: . @prefix xsd: . @prefix previousVersion: . :MachineOnlineStatus a samm:Aspect ; samm:properties ( :onlineStatus ) ; samm:operations ( ) . :onlineStatus a samm:Property ; (4) samm:description \"The current machine online status.\"@en ; samm:see previousVersion:machineOnlineStatus ; (5) samm:characteristic [ a samm-c:Enumeration ; samm:dataType xsd:string ; samm-c:values ( \"ON\" \"OFF\" \"BOOTING\" ) ] . The modeler decides that the Property name machineOnlineStatus is too long and redundant and renames it to onlineStatus ④. This is an unsafe change, because the JSON payload that corresponds to the Aspect Model is now changed structurally. The Aspect Model version is increased to 1.1.0: The Aspect Model still represents the same data which means that an increase of the major version is not warranted, but payloads are not any longer directly compatible, so the minor version is increased. To indicate the relation between machineOnlineStatus in the previous model version and onlineStatus in the current model version, an explicit link is added using samm:see ⑤. This is optional and purely informational and will show up in the Aspect Model’s generated documentation, but it is not a piece of information that consumers of the Aspect Model programmatically rely on. @prefix : . @prefix samm: . @prefix samm-c: . @prefix xsd: . :MachineOnlineStatus a samm:Aspect ; samm:properties ( [ samm:property :onlineStatus; samm:payloadName \"machineOnlineStatus\" ] ) ; (6) samm:operations ( ) . :onlineStatus a samm:Property ; samm:description \"The current machine online status.\"@en ; samm:characteristic [ a samm-c:Enumeration ; samm:dataType xsd:string ; samm-c:values ( \"ON\" \"OFF\" \"BOOTING\" ) ] . Renaming the Property in the last step is a change made to demonstrate dealing with unsafe changes. Alternatively, the modeler could rename the Property but still keep this change a safe change by specifying a samm:payloadName ⑥ that corresponds to the effective payload name of the Property in the previous version of the Aspect Model (i.e., 1.0.2). In this scenario, since the change is a safe change, the version is increased to 1.0.3 instead of 1.1.0. In the example scenario, when associating Aspect endpoints with a Digital Twin, three Aspect entries for the MachineOnlineStatus Aspect could be associated with a Digital Twin (one for each of the versions 1.0.0, 1.0.1 and 1.0.2) with the same Aspect endpoint that only actually implements model version 1.0.2, because payloads are compatible. For model version 1.1.0, a separate endpoint needs to be provided by the Aspect implementation. 1. However, a JSON Schema only describes a document’s structure, not its meaning or content.","title":"Model Evolution","component":"samm-specification","version":"snapshot","name":"model-evolution","url":"/samm-specification/snapshot/appendix/model-evolution.html","titles":[{"text":"Why is Model Evolution needed?","id":"why-is-model-evolution-needed"},{"text":"Decoupling of Models and Payload","id":"decoupling-of-models-and-payload"},{"text":"Safe Changes for Graceful Model Evolution","id":"safe-changes"},{"text":"Example: Evolution of an Aspect Model","id":"example"}]},"/samm-specification/snapshot/appendix/release-notes.html":{"text":"SAMM 2.1.0 is the first feature release on the Eclipse Semantic Modeling Framework with improvements on validation and documentation as follows: The validation rule \"all Properties defined in an Entity as well as in the Entity or AbstractEntity it is extending must have a unique name\" has been removed.

Issue on Github. The SAMM project was set up to be based on shared esmf-parent Maven parent project. Issue on Github. This is the first release in the ESMF. Its structure and content is similar to that of the Legacy BAMM Aspect Meta Model 2.0.0, which is why the version number 2.0.0 is kept. This release changes RDF namespaces and prefix names according to the move from the Open Manufacturing Platform (OMP) Semantic Data Structuring (SDS) working group BAMM Aspect Meta Model (BAMM) to the Eclipse Semantic Modeling Framework (ESMF) Semantic Aspect Meta Model (SAMM). Meta model URNs are changed from urn:bamm:io.openmanufacturing::# to urn:samm:org.eclipse.esmf.samm::#. The namespace rules for model elements changed accordingly from bamm to samm in the URN schema. RDF prefixes are renamed from bamm, bamm-c and bamm-e to samm, samm-c and samm-e, respectively. Version 1.0.0 of the meta model was released in the scope of the Open Manufacturing Platform (OMP) and was called BAMM Aspect Meta Model (BAMM). Version 2.0.0 was also released as BAMM, then re-released as Eclipse Semantic Modeling Framework (ESMF) Semantic Aspect Meta Model (SAMM) 2.0.0. Introduce Entity inheritance, the according Meta Model Element bamm:AbstractEntity and bamm:AbstractProperty as well as the bamm:extends attribute to define a hierarchy of Entities. This replaces the concept of refining an entity and the bamm:refines attribute in order to reduce complexity and modeling efforts. Remove the bamm:name attribute to remove redundancy. The \"short\" name of an element is the local name part of its URI, i.e., the part following the # symbol. The meta model elements Unit, QuantityKinds and their corresponding attributes have been moved from the unit namespace to the bamm namespace. The unit namespace is now solely reserved for the units of the unit catalog itself. The formal description (units.ttl) of the units catalog is now automatically generated from its original source (see Units) and the local adjustments. The localeCode and languageCode attributes have been moved from the bamm namespace to the bamm-c namespace. Shared model elements have been adjusted: The Point3d Entity has been changed to use Abstract Properties for its components; The Time Series Entity has been changed to use an Abstract Property for its value component The attributes bamm:properties, bamm:operations and bamm:events on bamm:Aspect are now optional, i.e., they do not have to be added any more even when they are empty lists. Various issues in the specification (including examples) have been fixed and phrasing has been improved. This is the initial release for the Open Manufacturing Platform.","title":"Release Notes - Semantic Aspect Meta Model","component":"samm-specification","version":"snapshot","name":"release-notes","url":"/samm-specification/snapshot/appendix/release-notes.html","titles":[{"text":"Release 2.1.0","id":"samm-2.1.0"},{"text":"Validation","id":"samm-2.1.0-validation"},{"text":"Documentation","id":"samm-2.1.0-documentation"},{"text":"Others","id":"samm-2.1.0-others"},{"text":"Release 2.0.0","id":"samm-2.0.0"},{"text":"Release 2.0.0 (Legacy: BAMM)","id":"bamm-2.0.0"},{"text":"Release 1.0.0","id":"bamm-1.0.0"}]},"/samm-specification/snapshot/appendix/unitcatalog.html":{"text":"For the description of a quantity kind’s structure, please see section units.

Still, such code partially also could be written directly on the domain model. Let’s now take a look at functionality, that is very complicated to write without the support of a Meta Model at hand. We’re talking about generic code, i.e. code that knows how to work with data and its properties, but doesn’t care, what data it exactly is. Let’s define a simple, but realistic example of such a generic piece of code. Assume you’re modeling data structures that handle all sorts of technical components, maybe a device that is broken up into its sub-components. Each sub-component is modeled with different properties, but they all share one thing: their unique identifier. For the application we’re developing it now is regularly needed, to retrieve a set of components and index them by their unique id, something like this: Map = subComponents.stream() .collect( Collectors.toMap( SubComponent::getId, Function.identity() ) ); However, we don’t only have this single kind of SubComponent. We have multiple, on different levels of our domain model. Additionally, we don’t have a clean inheritance hierarchy where we can assume that the unique id is always an Integer and always within the property getId(). If we still want to be able to write a generic solution to this requirement, our Static Meta Model comes to the rescue! All we need to know is any property (or property chain) which we use to perform the indexing: public Map index( List components, StaticProperty uniqueId ) { return components.stream() .collect( Collectors.toMap( uniqueId, Function.identity() ) ); } ... Map componentsById = index( subComponents, MetaSubComponent.ID ); Now you have an algorithm that will work on any Aspect or Entity which does have an unique identifier. Maybe you already spotted how easily such generic code can be pushed even further. Assume, that for some parts of the application you don’t want to index the component itself, but one of its properties (maybe the OEM). Again, using properties such an extension is elegant and simple: public Map index( List components, StaticProperty uniqueId, Function valueMapper ) { return components.stream() .collect( Collectors.toMap( uniqueId, valueMapper ) ); } ... Map componentsById = index( subComponents, MetaSubComponent.ID, Function.identity() ); Map componentOemsById = index( subComponents, MetaSubComponent.ID, MetaSubComponent.OEM ); In the same way that properties can be used to access data, they can also be used to filter and sort data. To filter elements based on their properties (or nested properties, via a Property Chain), the convenient builder PropertyPredicates exists. It provides the following entry points: Entry Point Types Description on( PropertyAccessor property ) C any containing type T any non-container property type For simple predicates on single-valued properties matchOn( PropertyAccessor property ) C any containing type T any type that extends a CharSequence Used to build contains and RegEx predicates compareOn( PropertyAccessor property ) C any containing type T any type that extends a Comparable Used to build (partial) range predicates like greaterThan or withinClosed on comparable properties onOptional( PropertyAccessor property ) C any containing type T any Optional type For simple predicates on Optional values. onCollection( PropertyAccessor property ) C any containing type T any type that extends a Collection Used to build predicates on collections, like contains or containsAllOf Let’s take a look and some examples using those builders: List movements = retrieveMovements(); // find all that are currently moving List currentlyMoving = movements.stream() .filter( PropertyPredicates.on( MetaMovement.IS_MOVING ).isEqualTo( true ) ) .toList(); // find all that have a speed within the range 10km/h withinSpeedRange = movements.stream() .filter( PropertyPredicates.compareOn( MetaMovement.SPEED ).withinClosed( 10.0f, 30.0f ) ) .toList(); Again assuming our example with a component and its subcomponents, let’s filter on collection-valued properties: List components = retrieveComponents(); var componentOem = PropertyChain.fromCollection( MetaComponent.SUB_COMPONENTS ) .to( MetaSubComponent.OEM ); List withOemAcme = components.stream() .filter( PropertyPredicates.onCollection( componentOem ).contains( \"ACME\" ) ) .toList(); To conveniently build even more complex predicates with AND or OR semantics you can for example use the Predicates utility from the Vavr library. Property-based sorting doesn’t require any special utilities at all, due to the fact that properties already implement the Function interface and thus can directly be used as a keyExtractor with Comparator.comparing(): List bySpeedAscending = movements.stream() .sorted( Comparator.comparing( MetaMovement.SPEED ) ) .toList();","title":"Advanced Usage","component":"esmf-developer-guide","version":"master","name":"advanced-usage","url":"/esmf-developer-guide/static-metaclasses/advanced-usage.html","titles":[{"text":"Writing Generic Code","id":"writing-generic-code"},{"text":"Filtering and Sorting with Properties","id":"filtering-and-sorting-with-properties"},{"text":"Filtering","id":"filtering"},{"text":"Sorting","id":"sorting"}]},"/esmf-developer-guide/static-metaclasses/basic-usage.html":{"text":"To get started with using Static Meta Models within your application you need to generate the respective Java artifacts using either the Java Tooling or Maven plugin. After the artifacts have been generated you’ll find for each Aspect and Entity a new source file called MetaElementName.java which contains the Static Meta Model. All the following chapters again assume the Movement Aspect with its accompanying static MetaMovement class. The Meta Classes contain some general Model information within static fields: Field Description Type (Sample) value NAMESPACE The namespace of this Model Element String urn:samm:org.eclipse.esmf.examples.movement:1.0.0# MODEL_ELEMENT_URN The full URN of this Model Element String urn:samm:org.eclipse.esmf.examples.movement:1.0.0#Movement CHARACTERISTIC_NAMESPACE The Characteristic Namespace of the Model String urn:samm:org.eclipse.esmf.samm:characteristic:2.1.0# INSTANCE The singleton instance of this Meta class. Used to access non-static information. MetaMovement N/A The instances of the Meta Classes themselves can be used for application development as well as the contained information about Properties, depending on which Model information is required. Most applications will predominantly use the property information, however when implementations take multiple Aspects and/or Entities into account, also class-level information can be of great use. Field or Method Description (Return) Type (Sample) value getModelClass() The Java Class for this Model Element Class MetaMovement.class getAspectModelUrn() The URN of this Model Element AspectModelUrn AspectModelUrn.fromUrn(MODEL_ELEMENT_URN) getMetaModelVersion() The used Meta Model version KnownVersion KnownVersion.SAMM_2_1_0 getName() The name of this Model Element String Movement getProperties() All StaticProperty​s of this Model Element List or List Arrays.asList(SOME_STRING, SOME_INT, SOME_FLOAT); getAllProperties() All StaticProperty​s of this Model Element, including inherited properties. If no inheritance is used it returns the same value as getProperties() List or List Arrays.asList(SOME_STRING, SOME_INT, SOME_FLOAT); For each property of the respective Model Element the Meta Class contains one StaticProperty field. The name of the field is derived from the property name, converting it into from camelCase to UPPER_UNDERSCORE. A property named firstName would result in the field FIRST_NAME. Each property then again provides information through its member methods: Method Description Return Type (Sample) value getPropertyType() The Java Class of this property including generics Class String.class, List.class getContainingType() The Java Class of the element containing this property (e.g. an Aspect or an Entity) Class Class getContainedType() Only present on properties with container types like List, Set, Optional etc. The Java Class of the element contained within the container. Class Class isComplexType() Whether this property has a complex type, e.g. an Entity. boolean true for complex types, false else getValue(Movement object) The property value of the given element instance The property type someStringValue (using the getter, e.g. object.getTestString()) Different kinds of Static Properties exist to reflect all possible elements within an Aspect Model: Property Type Description Generics StaticProperty A simple scalar property C is the containing type (an Aspect or Entity) T is the property type (e.g. String) StaticContainerProperty A property with a container type like Optional or Collection E is the containing type (an Aspect or Entity) C is the type inside the container (e.g. String) T is the property type (e.g. Optional) StaticUnitProperty A simple scalar property but with an additional method to get its Unit C is the containing type (an Aspect or Entity) T is the property type (e.g. String) All of the above Property types have a counterpart with a Constraint, namely StaticConstraintProperty, StaticConstraintContainerProperty and StaticConstraintUnitProperty. Their API and generics are the same, but they have an additional method to get a list of their constraints. Independent from what you’ll finally use a Property for it is important to understand how you can use them to navigate through your Model. Every Model Element that is a Property Container offers access to its properties - most prominently Aspects and Entities. Their properties are directly addressed using the respective fields from their Meta Classes. However, you can also go beyond that. Properties can be chained so that it’s possible to address properties nested inside your Model. This is useful in situations where it is required to use nested properties as if they would belong to a higher Element. Such operations can be for example: flattening data structures filtering on criteria defined on nested properties Property Chains are defined using type safe builders: PropertyChain latitude = PropertyChain.from( MetaMovement.POSITION ) .to( MetaSpatialPosition.LATITUDE ); Property Chains can follow deeply nested structures and are not limited in that. Assuming another Aspect that contains the structure Aspect → entity: Entity → subEntity: SubEntity we can define a chain like this: PropertyChain nestedString = PropertyChain.from( MetaAspect.ENTITY ) .via( MetaEntity.SUB_ENTITY ) .to( MetaSubEntity.STRING_PROPERTY ); Container properties can also appear anywhere, either at the start or in the middle or end of a chain. The respective container type then will be propagated from the moment on it appears. One thing to note is, that for collection valued properties the concrete collection type is not preserved but always replaced with a List. ContainerPropertyChain, Float> altitude = PropertyChain.from( MetaMovement.POSITION ) .to( MetaSpatialPosition.ALTITUDE ); ContainerPropertyChain, String> nestedEntityCollectionStrings = PropertyChain.from( MetaAspect.ENTITY ) .viaCollection( MetaEntity.SUB_ENTITY_LIST ) .to( MetaSubEntity.STRING_PROPERTY ); Static Properties can act as accessors and thus be used to retrieve the data they represent from instances of their enclosing Model Elements. All Static Properties provide the method R getValue(C object) and additionally extend the interface Function so that it is also possible to directly use them within stream operations like .map(). For example, simply extracting and printing all property values of an entity could be written like this: Entity entity = getEntity(); MetaEntity.INSTANCE.getProperties().stream() .map( StaticProperty::getValue ) .forEach( System.out::println ); When accessing the values of Property Chains please note the following: Chain resolution of non-Optional chains ends at null values and also will be returned as the result. Client code thus has to handle those situations accordingly. Nested structures with multiple collections in between might result in large final Lists of data. For example, if you have an Aspect with a list of 1000 or more measurements and each measurement again contains a list of a few hundred data samples, resolving the chain to the data samples might easily give you results into the millions.","title":"Basic Usage","component":"esmf-developer-guide","version":"master","name":"basic-usage","url":"/esmf-developer-guide/static-metaclasses/basic-usage.html","titles":[{"text":"Meta Class Overview","id":"meta-class-overview"},{"text":"General Information within the Meta Classes","id":"general-information-within-the-meta-classes"},{"text":"Type and Property Information within the Meta Classes","id":"type-and-property-information-within-the-meta-classes"},{"text":"Types of Static Properties","id":"types-of-static-properties"},{"text":"Writing Code using Static Meta Classes","id":"writing-code-using-static-meta-classes"},{"text":"Addressing Properties","id":"addressing-properties"},{"text":"Accessing Property data","id":"accessing-property-data"}]},"/esmf-developer-guide/static-metaclasses/index.html":{"text":"To fully leverage the power of Aspect Models during application development generating the Java classes for Aspect Models is usually the first step. However, while it allows to easily and quickly build an application that uses the data of single Aspects, it does not help to build applications that can handle the data of Aspects in a generic way, that means: using the Meta Model. What would be an example for such a case? Let’s assume a very simple application, that still shows very well, why using the Meta Model is mandatory despite the problem at hand seeming not very complex at first. Let’s assume we’re starting our application with the well-known Movement Aspect, but possibly more Aspects are to come in the future. To easily get a quick overview of the Aspect data we want to write a console application that pulls the data from the Aspect and prints it to console nicely formatted. Using a built-in mechanism like generated toString methods might work for a very first version and for simple Aspect Models, but our Aspect already contains nested entity structures and future ones could contain even more complex ones, with lists of entities within lists. And apart from that, we want to print them really nicely, with indentation and other formatting applied, maybe like this: [Movement] - Is moving: YES - Speed: 35 km/h - Speed limit warning: yellow - Position: - Latitude: 45.2 - Longitude: 32.7 - Altitude: 17.0 ... Now, one possibility would of course be to write specific code that does exactly that for this Aspect. Code like that however has multiple drawbacks: it’s tedious to write (maybe not for one or two Aspects, but most applications will work with way more Aspects), error-prone and - most importantly - it requires touching every time your Aspect Model changes. A second option that often comes to mind when working with models of any kind is code generation, just as we use it for the Java POJOs through the respective tooling. While code generation is a great tool for situations where the input might change quite often, but the targeted use case does not, it isn’t the best fit for use cases, that most likely will evolve over time. Building applications with Aspect Models is most of the time exactly that - how you use the Aspect Data is often subject to different changes. Adapting a generator or template for that all the time in the end does not buy you much. What we would need is a possibility to work on the Meta Model and Aspect Model at the same time, to be able to explicitly work with or iterate over its properties. Taking the Aspect Model from above, we could e.g. write code like this: Movement movement = retrieveMovement(); for ( Property p : getAllProperties() ) { System.out.println( String.format( \"- %s: %s\", p.getName(), p.getValue( movement ) ) ); } This code may not look very special at first glance or you might ask the question where’s the big difference compared to the other attempts we discussed above? Let’s take a deeper look. Most obviously we are able to handle all properties of an Aspect with exactly one line - we print the property name and the value. This is the first major advantage, because as long as we do not have the need to apply very specific formatting to single elements, this single line will be a fit for any property of the Aspect - also those, that we might add to (or also remove from) the Aspect Model in the future. This directly brings us to a related advantage, that is hidden in the loop itself: the getAllProperties() method. Where does this come from? We’ll see later on, that we use Static Meta Classes for that, but for now let’s assume, that this part will be generated. Remember that we said, code generation is great for anything where the use case does only rarely change? Getting a list of our Model’s properties is exactly such a use case. We want a list and that’s that. This means, whenever we change our Aspect Model, we run the code generation step once to get the updated artifacts, and after that the code above will work still exactly the same - but it also will automatically pick up the changes to the list of our properties. Even this over-simplified example already shows the great benefits of this approach, as it allows developers to write very stable generic code that can easily also perform much more complex tasks, as long as the input that is required is made up of an Aspect Model and its data. Granted, code like above could also be written using a dynamically loaded Aspect Model (note the missing Static). So in order to close this motivation let’s assume another small requirement for our application that is at least rather ugly to implement: our Aspects not only carry the data we need for our daily work, but also a lot of data which is not strictly required to be printed - or maybe we just want to print it when some kind of verbose mode is enabled. Something like this requires filtering the list of properties we use. Now how to do this? Of course, we apply some filter predicate and skip let’s say the properties called speed and speedLimitWarning. As we have to use string matching on human knowledge about the Aspect Model, we again can quickly identify two issues: string matching code is always ugly and subject to typing errors if we ever remove e.g. the property speedLimitWarning this will not break our code, but leave us with something that can be surprising to another developer taking over - code, that’s outdated and nobody noticed. How would this requirement look like, if we now assume we already have such an accompanying static meta class being called MetaMovement for our Aspect? Movement movement = retrieveMovement(); List allProperties = getAllProperties(); if (mode != \"VERBOSE\") { allProperties.removeAll( List.of( MetaMovement.SPEED_LIMIT, MetaMovement.SPEED_LIMIT_WARNING ) ); } for ( Property p : getAllProperties() ) { System.out.println( String.format( \"- %s: %s\", p.getName(), p.getValue( movement ) ) ); } This solves both problems described above and adds convenience on top: the static class is generated from the Aspect Model - no need to repeat the property names by hand the static class contains actual Meta Model elements - even no need for strings at all! the intent of the code is easier to grasp if we ever remove the property speedLimitWarning, the above code will not compile until we remove the now invalid property reference - we gained compile-time safety!","title":"Using Java Static Meta Classes","component":"esmf-developer-guide","version":"master","name":"index","url":"/esmf-developer-guide/static-metaclasses/index.html","titles":[{"text":"Motivation","id":"motivation"}]},"/esmf-developer-guide/tooling-guide/bamm-migration.html":{"text":"BAMM is now known as SAMM. Since january 2023, the Semantic Aspect Meta Model (SAMM) is developed by the Eclipse Semantic Modeling Framework (ESMF) project. However, SAMM and its accompanying tooling was not developed from scratch here but is based on what was previously known as the BAMM Aspect Meta Model. BAMM was developed and maintained by the Semantic Data Structuring (SDS) working group of the Open Manufacturing Platform (OMP). With the transition from OMP to ESMF, identifiers and artifact names changed. The following sections guide you through the necessary changes in order to migrate from BAMM to SAMM. Meta model semantics have not changed between BAMM 2.0.0 and SAMM 2.0.0. This means that the way an Aspect Model is constructed remains the same after updating to SAMM. However, since the meta model namespaces have changed, models need to be updated to use the new namespaces. As a rule of thumb, every occurence of io.openmanufacturing changes to org.eclipse.esmf.samm and every occurence of bamm changes to samm. The RDF namespaces have changed as follows: Table 1. Prefixes BAMM prefix SAMM prefix bamm samm bamm-c samm-c bamm-e samm-e unit unit Table 2.

All of the components described in the following subsections can either be included in your project using a dedicated dependency (as described in the respective subsection), or you can use the aspect-model-starter artifact that aggregates all necessary dependencies: Maven org.eclipse.esmf esmf-aspect-model-starter 2.9.8 Gradle Groovy DSL implementation 'org.eclipse.esmf:esmf-aspect-model-starter:2.9.8' Gradle Kotlin DSL implementation(\"org.eclipse.esmf:esmf-aspect-model-starter:2.9.8\") The tooling can be made available in two different versions: release and milestone. The release version represents a stable version of the product and can be referenced in your projects in the usual way from the Maven Central repository. There is also the possibility to have the intermediate builds made available, these are called milestone builds. Instead of Maven Central, these are released via GitHub Packages mechanism. To be able to use the artifacts released in this way in your projects, first the right repository has to be added to your pom.xml file: github ESMF SDK https://maven.pkg.github.com/eclipse-esmf/esmf-sdk true true Then the desired dependencies can be referenced in the usual way. For an example, please refer to Github - Installing a package. The esmf-sdk components are built with Java 17 and require a JDK >= 17 such as Adoptium Temurin. The esmf-sdk can also be used with a Java 17-compatible GraalVM JDK. With GraalVM you need to make the Graal JavaScript component available, as parts of the SDK such as the Aspect Model validation component require embedded JavaScript execution: For using the esmf-sdk in the GraalVM itself, install the JS component using the GraalVM Updater: gu install js For using the esmf-sdk with GraalVM native-image, be sure to use the --language:js option when building the native image; for more information see polyglot programming. When using esmf-sdk with a GraalVM JDK and you target native-image compilation, add a dependency to the esmf-native-support module. This will add the necessary configuration for esmf-sdk resources, reflection and initialization that is required by the compiler: Maven org.eclipse.esmf esmf-aspect-model-starter 2.9.8 Gradle Groovy DSL implementation 'org.eclipse.esmf:esmf-aspect-model-starter:2.9.8' Gradle Kotlin DSL implementation(\"org.eclipse.esmf:esmf-aspect-model-starter:2.9.8\") The aspect-model-urn artifact provides a way to parse and validate Aspect model element URNs as described in the specification. Show used imports import org.eclipse.esmf.aspectmodel.urn.AspectModelUrn; final AspectModelUrn urn = AspectModelUrn.fromUrn( \"urn:samm:com.example:1.0.0#Example\" ); final String namespace = urn.getNamespaceMainPart(); // com.example final String name = urn.getName(); // Example final String version = urn.getVersion(); // 1.0.0 final String urnPrefix = urn.getUrnPrefix(); // urn:samm:com.example:1.0.0# To include the artifact, use the following dependencies: Maven org.eclipse.esmf esmf-aspect-model-urn 2.9.8 Gradle Groovy DSL implementation 'org.eclipse.esmf:esmf-aspect-model-urn:2.9.8' Gradle Kotlin DSL implementation(\"org.eclipse.esmf:esmf-aspect-model-urn:2.9.8\") Aspect models are, like the Semantic Aspect Meta Model, described using the Resource Description Format (RDF, [rdf11]) and the Terse RDF Triple Language syntax (TTL, [turtle]). When an Aspect Model is loaded, there are two ways of working with it: Either on the abstraction level of the underlying RDF/Turtle serialization, or on the native Java Aspect Model level, where the model is represented as a Java object graph. Both approaches have different use cases and advantages and both are supported by the Aspect Model Java tooling: Working on the RDF level Using the Java Aspect model Low level, focus on power and flexibility Flexibly navigate and filter the model on the RDF statements level Work with models that are valid RDF, but incomplete Aspect Models, e.g. in Aspect model editors Use SPARQL [sparql] to execute complex queries on Aspect Models High level, focus on convenience and type-safety Use Aspect Model-specific interfaces for type-safe code Use Java native data types (e.g. java.math.BigInteger for xsd:integer) Easily traverse the model on the abstraction level of Aspect Model elements As a rule of thumb, if your use case mostly consists of consuming Aspect models, you should prefer the Java Aspect model, if you create or edit Aspect models, or build code interfacing with other RDF vocabularies, this is better done using the RDF API. To load an AspectModel, you use the org.eclipse.esmf.aspectmodel.loader.AspectModelLoader class. An instance of AspectModelLoader provides load() methods to load an Aspect Model from an InputStream, one or multiple Files, or a number of AspectModelUrn (where you can delegate finding out where a model element is defined to the AspectModelLoader - details on that are explained in the next section). The AspectModelLoader loads Aspect Models based on the most recent version of the Semantic Aspect Meta Model and previous versions: Models based on older meta model versions are automatically translated to models corresponding to the latest meta model version. The resulting AspectModel object contains information about the loaded model elements, their namespaces and the files they were defined in. Details about the structure of these objects can be found in the Decision Record 0007. The AspectModel provides the methods elements(), files() and namespaces() as well as the convenience methods aspects() (which returns all Aspect elements in the model) and aspect(), which returns the single Aspect element if one exists. Show used imports import org.eclipse.esmf.aspectmodel.loader.AspectModelLoader; import org.eclipse.esmf.metamodel.AspectModel; import org.eclipse.esmf.metamodel.ModelElement; final AspectModel aspectModel = new AspectModelLoader().load( // a File, InputStream or AspectModelUrn new File( \"aspect-models/org.eclipse.esmf.examples.movement/1.0.0/Movement.ttl\" ) ); // Do something with the elements for ( final ModelElement element : aspectModel.elements() ) { System.out.printf( \"Model element: %s has URN %s%n\", element.getName(), element.urn() ); } // Directly work with the Aspect, if the AspectModel happens to contain // exactly one Aspect. If there are 0 or >1 Aspects, this will throw an exception. System.out.println( \"Aspect URN: \" + aspectModel.aspect().urn() ); } } To include the Java Aspect Model artifact, use the following dependency: Maven org.eclipse.esmf esmf-aspect-meta-model-java 2.9.8 Gradle Groovy DSL implementation 'org.eclipse.esmf:esmf-aspect-meta-model-java:2.9.8' Gradle Kotlin DSL implementation(\"org.eclipse.esmf:esmf-aspect-meta-model-java:2.9.8\") The example in the last section showed how a self-contained Aspect Model file can be loaded (i.e., a file that does not refer to model element definitions in other files or namespaces). Whenever models are loaded that could contain such references, or you want to load a model element by URN, the AspectModelLoader relies on so-called resolution strategies. A resolution strategy is a function that takes a model element identifier (a model element URN) as an input and returns the content of the file that contains the corresponding model element definition. Note that this is not necessarily a file in the local filesystem, but it could also be a remote file or even exist only virtually as a collection of statements in an RDF triple store. Several ResolutionStrategy​s are provided that can be instantiated and passed to the AspectModelLoader constructor to enable it to find model element definitions: The FileSystemStrategy resolves elements from files in the file system which are either structured in the models directory structure or exist as flat list of files in one directory (by using FileSystemStrategy with a FlatModelsRoot). The ClassPathStrategy resolves model elements from resources in the Java class path. The FromLoadedFileStrategy resolves model elements from an AspectModelFile that already resides in memory. The EitherStrategy can be used to chain two or more different ResolutionStrategy​s. The ExternalResolverStrategy delegates resolution to an external command such as a script; it is used in the implementation of the --custom-resolver option of the samm-cli. The GitHubStrategy resolves model elements from repositories hosted on GitHub. In addition, custom resolution strategies can be provided by implementing the ResolutionStrategy interface. The following example demonstrates how to pass a custom instance of a ResolutionStrategy and resolve a model element by URN: Show used imports import java.io.File; import java.nio.file.Path; import java.nio.file.Paths; import org.eclipse.esmf.aspectmodel.loader.AspectModelLoader; import org.eclipse.esmf.aspectmodel.resolver.FileSystemStrategy; import org.eclipse.esmf.aspectmodel.resolver.ResolutionStrategy; import org.eclipse.esmf.aspectmodel.urn.AspectModelUrn; import org.eclipse.esmf.metamodel.AspectModel; import org.eclipse.esmf.metamodel.vocabulary.SammNs; import org.apache.jena.vocabulary.RDF; // The directory containing the models folder structure, // see models directory structure final Path modelsRoot = Paths.get( \"aspect-models\" ); final ResolutionStrategy fileSystemStrategy = new FileSystemStrategy( modelsRoot ); final AspectModelUrn urn = AspectModelUrn.fromUrn( \"urn:samm:org.eclipse.esmf.examples.movement:1.0.0#Movement\" ); final AspectModel result = new AspectModelLoader( fileSystemStrategy ).load( urn ); The following example shows how to use the AspectModelLoad to load an Aspect Model. Show used imports import java.io.File; import java.nio.file.Path; import java.nio.file.Paths; import org.eclipse.esmf.aspectmodel.loader.AspectModelLoader; import org.eclipse.esmf.aspectmodel.resolver.FileSystemStrategy; import org.eclipse.esmf.aspectmodel.resolver.ResolutionStrategy; import org.eclipse.esmf.aspectmodel.urn.AspectModelUrn; import org.eclipse.esmf.metamodel.AspectModel; import org.eclipse.esmf.metamodel.vocabulary.SammNs; import org.apache.jena.vocabulary.RDF; final AspectModel aspectModel = new AspectModelLoader().load( // a File, InputStream or AspectModelUrn ); // Do something with the Aspect Model on the RDF level. // Example: List the URNs of all samm:Entitys aspectModel.mergedModel().listStatements( null, RDF.type, SammNs.SAMM.Entity() ) .forEachRemaining( statement -> System.out.println( statement.getSubject().getURI() ) ); After loading an AspectModel using the AspectModelLoader, you can access the mergedModel() on the AspectModel, which represents the merged RDF graph of all source files that were loaded in the model and therefore contains all transitively referenced model element definitions. Alternatively, you can also access the sourceModel() of each Aspect Model file given by files(), which will return only the RDF graph of this file. The serialize an Aspect into its corresponding RDF/Turtle representation, you can use the AspectSerializer, as demonstrated in the example below: Show used imports import java.io.File; import org.eclipse.esmf.aspectmodel.AspectModelFile; import org.eclipse.esmf.aspectmodel.serializer.AspectSerializer; import org.eclipse.esmf.aspectmodel.loader.AspectModelLoader; import org.eclipse.esmf.metamodel.AspectModel; // AspectModel as returned by the AspectModelLoader final AspectModel aspectModel = // ... // A String that contains the pretty printed Aspect Model final String aspectString = AspectSerializer.INSTANCE.aspectToString( aspectModel.aspect() ); Alternatively, you can also serialize a complete AspectModelFile: AspectModelFile aspectModelFile = // ... final String fileString = AspectSerializer.INSTANCE.aspectModelFileToString( aspectModelFile ); To include the serializer artifact, use the following dependencies: Maven org.eclipse.esmf esmf-aspect-model-serializer 2.9.8 Gradle Groovy DSL implementation 'org.eclipse.esmf:esmf-aspect-model-serializer:2.9.8' Gradle Kotlin DSL implementation(\"org.eclipse.esmf:esmf-aspect-model-serializer:2.9.8\") Aspect Models are validated using the AspectModelValidator. Validation returns a list of Violation​s. A violation has a human-readable message and a unique error code and provides access to the EvaluationContext which contains references to the model element that caused the violation and the SHACL shape that triggered the violation. Each possible type of violation is a subtype of the Violation interface and provides additional context information specific to this type, for example, the MinLengthViolation provides int min (the allowed length) and int actual (the length that was encountered in the model). Consider the following example: Show used imports import java.io.File; import java.util.List; import org.eclipse.esmf.aspectmodel.loader.AspectModelLoader; import org.eclipse.esmf.aspectmodel.shacl.violation.Violation; import org.eclipse.esmf.aspectmodel.validation.services.AspectModelValidator; import org.eclipse.esmf.aspectmodel.validation.services.DetailedViolationFormatter; import org.eclipse.esmf.aspectmodel.validation.services.ViolationFormatter; import org.eclipse.esmf.metamodel.AspectModel; // AspectModel as returned by the AspectModelLoader final AspectModel aspectModel = // ... final List violations = new AspectModelValidator().validateModel( aspectModel ); if ( violations.isEmpty() ) { // Aspect Model is valid! return; } final String validationReport = new ViolationFormatter().apply( violations ); (1) final String detailedReport = new DetailedViolationFormatter().apply( violations ); class MyViolationVisitor implements Violation.Visitor { (2) // ... } // Turn the list of Violations into a list of custom descriptions final Violation.Visitor visitor = new MyViolationVisitor(); final List result = violations.stream() .map( violation -> violation.accept( visitor ) ) .toList(); 1 To format the validation result into an human-readable form, use the ViolationFormatter or the DetailedViolationFormatter. Note that those are only intended for text-based interfaces such as CLIs. 2 Every application dealing with validation results that needs to transform the results into some different structure can implement the Violation.Visitor Interface with a suitable target type (String used as an example here) and use the visitor to handle the different types of Violations in a type-safe way. The AspectModelValidator also provides the loadModel(Supplier) method that can be used in conjunction with () → new AspectModeLoader().load(…​) to have exceptions that might be created during the Aspect Model loading process, for example due to model resolution failures or syntax errors in the input files, be turned into a List that can be passed to the aforementioned violation formatters. This allows for custom structured handling of problems that occur during model loading. To include the model validator, use the following dependencies: Maven org.eclipse.esmf esmf-aspect-model-validator 2.9.8 Gradle Groovy DSL implementation 'org.eclipse.esmf:esmf-aspect-model-validator:2.9.8' Gradle Kotlin DSL implementation(\"org.eclipse.esmf:esmf-aspect-model-validator:2.9.8\") Different types of artifacts can be generated from an Aspect model. All corresponding generators are included in the following dependency: Maven org.eclipse.esmf esmf-aspect-model-document-generators 2.9.8 Gradle Groovy DSL implementation 'org.eclipse.esmf:esmf-aspect-model-document-generators:2.9.8' Gradle Kotlin DSL implementation(\"org.eclipse.esmf:esmf-aspect-model-document-generators:2.9.8\") The documentation generation APIs provide methods that take as an argument a Function. This is a mapping function that takes a file name as an input (which is determined by the respective generator) and returns a corresponding OutputStream, for example (but not necessarily) a FileOutputStream. By providing this function when calling the generator method, you can control where the output is written to, even when the generator creates multiple files. For the code examples in the following subsections, we assume that the following method is defined for calling the generators: OutputStream outputStreamForName( final String aspectFileName ) { // Create an OutputStream for the file name, e.g. a FileOutputStream } Using the AspectModelDiagramGenerator, automatically layouted diagrams can be created for Aspect models in the formats PNG and SVG. Show used imports import java.io.OutputStream; import java.util.Locale; import java.util.Set; import org.eclipse.esmf.aspectmodel.generator.diagram.AspectModelDiagramGenerator; import org.eclipse.esmf.aspectmodel.generator.diagram.AspectModelDiagramGenerator.Format; import org.eclipse.esmf.aspectmodel.loader.AspectModelLoader; import org.eclipse.esmf.metamodel.AspectModel; // AspectModel as returned by the AspectModelLoader final AspectModel aspectModel = // ... final AspectModelDiagramGenerator generator = new AspectModelDiagramGenerator( aspectModel.aspect() ); (1) // Variant 1: Generate a diagram in SVG format using @en descriptions and preferredNames from the model final OutputStream output = outputStreamForName( \"diagram.svg\" ); generator.generateDiagram( Format.SVG, Locale.ENGLISH, output ); (2) output.close(); // Variant 2: Generate diagrams in multiple formats, for all languages that are present in the model. generator.generateDiagrams( Set.of( Format.PNG, Format.SVG ), this::outputStreamForName ); (3) 1 The diagram generator is initialized with the loaded model. 2 The simple call for one output format and one language (i.e., descriptions and preferredNames of one locale) takes one output stream to write the image to. 3 It is also possible to generate multiple diagrams, one for each combination of output format and language. For that, the set of target formats is given as well as a mapping function. A HTML reference documentation for an Aspect model can be generated as shown in the following code sample. The documentation contains an overview diagram and describes the model elements as specified in the Aspect model. Preferred names and descriptions in the respective language from the Aspect model are shown in the resulting document as part of each model element.

The sample JSON payload generator is used to create a valid JSON payload for an Aspect model as it could be returned by an Aspect that implements that Aspect model. This follows the mapping rules as defined in the Meta Model specification. The generator uses samm:exampleValue​s of Properties if present, otherwise random values corresponding to the respective data types are generated.

In case the Entity instances contain Properties with a sorted collection as their data type, the order of the values of said collection in the Entity instances is not preserved in the generated OpenAPI specification. Preserving this order in OpenAPI is not possible at this point. The AsyncAPI specification generator creates either a JSON Schema or a Yaml Spec that specifies an Aspect regarding to the AsyncApi specification.

The current implementation provides support for the Databricks SQL dialect and a mapping strategy that uses a denormalized table, i.e., the table contains one column for each Property used in the Aspect Model (or any of its transitively referenced Entities).

Aspects and Entities become Java classes; their Properties become fields in the classes. Characteristics are not first-class elements, but are implicitly represented by the usage of corresponding data types (e.g. using java.util.Set as the type for the Set Characteristic of a Property) or javax.validation annotations. The generated classes can be used in a straightforward fashion, but they do not contain information about the underlying Aspect model such as its version number. Parts of the Aspect model that have no representation in its corresponding JSON payload are not part of those classes either, in particular descriptions and preferred names. These classes are called POJOs (Plain Old Java Objects), as they do not contain logic but serve mainly as data containers. The generated code represents the Aspect model itself: It is a type-safe variant of the model and includes every information that is also present in the model such as Characteristics, descriptions including language tags and original XSD data types. It is however not intended to store payload corresponding to an Aspect. Theses classes are called static meta classes, because they are created at compile time (static) and talk about the structure of the information, not the information itself (meta). Depending on the use case, you would either use one or both of the types simultaneously. To include the Java generator, use the following dependencies: Maven org.eclipse.esmf esmf-aspect-model-java-generator 2.9.8 Gradle Groovy DSL implementation 'org.eclipse.esmf:esmf-aspect-model-java-generator:2.9.8' Gradle Kotlin DSL implementation(\"org.eclipse.esmf:esmf-aspect-model-java-generator:2.9.8\") In the Java code generated from an Aspect model, the scalar Aspect model data types are mapped to native Java types. The following table lists the correspondences.

Firstly, when instantiating the generator, you pass a flag indicating whether Jackson annotations should be generated in the class. Secondly, the name mapping function passed to the generation method takes a QualifiedName instead of a String, so that you can decide how to handle the package structure of the class.

The custom macros must be defined in a single template file. The path to the template file as well as its name may be passed as arguments to the code generation, e.g. using the SAMM-CLI.

Central element of the AAS is the concept of Submodels, which describe certain aspects of a Digital Twin. The SAMM Aspect Meta Model allows to specify aspects of a digital twin and its semantics. The AAS Generator module provides mapping implementations to derive AAS Submodels from SAMM Aspect Models. On the one hand, this allows to integrate SAMM models in AAS environments and on the other hand it allows AAS submodels to be described with rich semantics, as it is possible with SAMM. In the following section, the mapping rules applied by the generator are explained. The rules apply to SAMM v2.0.0 and AAS Specification Part 1 V3.0RC01. SAMM AAS Comment samm:Aspect aas:Submodel with kind=Template Empty Asset and AssetAdministrationShell entries are added to the output file samm:name aas:Submodel.idShort samm:preferredName aas:Submodel.displayName samm:description aas:Submodel.description samm:property see samm:Property samm:operation see samm:Operation samm:Aspect.urn aas:Submodel.semanticId samm:Property aas:Property, aas:SubmodelElementCollection The AAS type is derived from the type of the SAMM Characteristic specifying the SAMM property. Depending on the type it is decided what the resulting AAS element will be. In case of an Entity it will result in a SubmodelElementCollection. It will also be a SubmodelElementCollection if the SAMM Characteristic is of a Collection type (see the Characteristics taxonomy). In all other cases an aas:Property will be generated samm:Property.name aas:Property.idShort samm:Property.urn aas:ConceptDescription.identification.id, aas:Property.semanticId samm:Property.preferredName aas:Property.displayName samm:Property.description aas:Property.description Note: Also mapped to aas:DataSpecificationIEC61360.definition of the aas:ConceptDescription of this property samm:Property.exampleValue aas:Property.value samm:Characteristic.dataType aas:Property.valueType samm:Operation Operation in/out parameters are not used in SAMM so the mapping only generates input variables and output variables in AAS samm-c:Characteristic aas:SubmodelElement, aas:ConceptDescription Characteristics in SAMM define the semantics of a property, which includes there types as well as links to further definitions (standards, dictionaries, etc), a natural language description and name in different languages. Type and description are separated in AAS, which is why there is not a one-to-one mapping of a Characteristic to one element in AAS but rather Characteristics are used in the mapping of Properties, first, to guide the generation process and, second, to capture semantics in ConceptDescriptions of properties with data specification \"DataSpecificationIEC61360\" of the AAS. samm-c:Collection aas:SubmodelElementList, aas:ConceptDescription The general remarks to Characteristics apply also to Collection type Characteristics. However, properties referencing Collections are mapped to SubmodelElementLists. Specific properties of collections are mapped. samm:Set is unique, samm:SortedSet is unique and sorted, samm:List is sorted. samm-c:Quantifiable aas:SubmodelElement, aas:ConceptDescription The general remarks to Characteristics apply also to Quantifiable type Characteristics. Quantifiables (also Duration and Measurement) reference a unit, which is added to the ConceptDescription corresponding the mapped Characteristic. samm-c:Either aas:SubmodelElement, aas:ConceptDescription The general remarks to Characteristics apply also to Either. However, the Either characteristic has two distinct entries of which one is to be selected. This concept is not present in AAS. Thus, both entries will be written to a Submodel template, where one has to be ignored. samm-c:Trait aas:SubmodelElement, aas:ConceptDescription The general remarks to Characteristics apply also to Trait. However, the constraint of a trait will be ignored and only the base type will be evaluated, which will act as the characteristic of a property. samm-c:Code aas:SubmodelElement, aas:ConceptDescription Similar to plain Characteristic. samm-c:StructuredValue aas:SubmodelElement, aas:ConceptDescription The general remarks to Characteristics apply also to StructuredValue. However, AAS has no concpet like deconstruction rule. Thus, the deconstruction rule and the sub properties of the deconstruction entity will be ignored and only the Characteristic is mapped. samm-c:Enumeration aas:SubmodelElement, aas:ConceptDescription The general remarks to Characteristics apply also to Enumerations. Additionally, the values of an Enumeration are mapped to a valueList of a DataSpecificationIEC61360. samm-c:State aas:SubmodelElement, aas:ConceptDescription Same as Enumeration. samm-c:MultiLanguageText aas:MultiLanguageProperty if a MultiLanguageText is used in SAMM it is mapped to the MultiLanguageProperty in AAS. The AAS Generator implements a base set of features, which are mapped from SAMM to AAS. However, there are still limitations: Predefined entity mapping (FileResource would be mapped to aas:File) samm-c:Either is mapped to aas:SubmodelElementCollection with two entries for left and right side Recursive optional properties of SAMM model are not included in output but dropped straight away The following code demonstrates how the API to translate an Aspect Model into one of the valid AAS formats (JSON, XML, AASX) is used: Show used imports import org.eclipse.esmf.aspectmodel.aas.AasGenerationConfig; import org.eclipse.esmf.aspectmodel.aas.AasGenerationConfigBuilder; import org.eclipse.esmf.aspectmodel.aas.AspectModelAasGenerator; import org.eclipse.esmf.aspectmodel.aas.AasFileFormat; import org.eclipse.esmf.aspectmodel.loader.AspectModelLoader; import org.eclipse.esmf.metamodel.Aspect; import org.eclipse.esmf.metamodel.AspectModel; // AspectModel as returned by the AspectModelLoader final AspectModel aspectModel = // ... final AasGenerationConfig config = AasGenerationConfigBuilder.builder() .format( AasFileFormat.AASX ) .aspectData( null ) // Optional: Provide a JsonNode representing Aspect data .propertyMappers( List.of() ) // Optional: Customize SAMM->AAS property mapping .build(); new AspectModelAasGenerator( aspect, config ).generate( this::outputStreamForName ); To include the translator artifact, use the following dependencies: Maven org.eclipse.esmf esmf-aspect-aas-generator 2.9.8 Gradle Groovy DSL implementation 'org.eclipse.esmf:esmf-aspect-model-aas-generator:2.9.8' Gradle Kotlin DSL implementation(\"org.eclipse.esmf:esmf-aspect-model-aas-generator:2.9.8\") It is also possible to translate AAS Submodel Templates to Aspect Models using a best-effort.

It is available as a native executable for multiple platforms (Windows, Linux and macOS) and as an executable JAR file. You can find the latest release [on GitHub](https://github.com/eclipse-esmf/esmf-sdk/releases/latest). For the executable jar, call java -jar samm-cli-2.9.8.jar followed by one of the following subcommands (e.g., java -jar samm-cli-2.9.8.jar help). In the following sections, samm will be used as the command name. To make samm-cli easier to call, you can add an alias to the configuration of the shell of your choice. For example, for Bash, you could add the following line to .bashrc: alias samm='java -jar /location/to/samm-cli-2.9.8.jar' For the Windows native executable: Download: Download via above link or visit the repository of the Java SDK which contains the SAMM CLI at the Github releases page and download executable file for Windows. Extract: extract it to a location of your choice. Open samm.exe: This will open a command prompt in this directory, where you can enter further samm commands. Input: Make sure to read the below documentation and provide model files in the correct directory structure. For the Linux native executable: Download: Download via above link or visit the repository of the Java SDK which contains the SAMM CLI at the Github releases page and download executable file for Linux. Extract: Unpack the archive to your preferred directory. Open Terminal: Open the Terminal and navigate to the directory with the application. Input: Make sure to read the below documentation and provide model files in the correct directory structure. Execute: Run the application using the command ./samm. Successful execution of a command is signaled by returning 0. In case of a logical or other internal error the error code 1 is being returned. Missing or wrong command parameters result in error code 2 being returned. To get an overview of all commands and subcommands, use samm help. To get help for a certain subcommand, use help before the subcommand name, e.g., samm help aspect, samm help aspect validate or samm help aas to aspect. Each subcommand can have its own set of options which allow the user to further fine-tune the execution of the command. The available options and their meaning can also be seen in the help text of the individual subcommands. In place of in the command descriptions below, you can provide either one of: a relative file name, such as AspectModel.ttl or ./somewhere/AspectModel.ttl (on Linux and MacOS) or .\\somewhere\\AspectModel.ttl (on Windows), an absolut file name, such as /home/me/aspect-models/org.eclipse.esmf.example/1.0.0/AspectModel.ttl (on Linux and MacOS) or C:\\Users\\me\\aspect-models\\org.eclipse.esmf.example\\1.0.0\\AspectModel.ttl (on Windows), a URL pointing to a .ttl file in a publically accessible GitHub repository, such as https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/sldt-semantic-models/blob/main/io.catenax.battery.battery_pass/6.0.0/BatteryPass.ttl or https://github.com/eclipse-esmf/esmf-aspect-model-editor/blob/main/core/apps/ame/src/assets/aspect-models/org.eclipse.examples/1.0.0/Movement.ttl, an Aspect Model URN, such as urn:samm:org.eclipse.esmf.example:1.0.0#Aspect, however note that this also requires setting a models source, see configuration of model resolution for more information.

You can configure where such lookup should be done: Using the --models-root switch, you can provide a directory that follows the models directory structure. This switch can be repeated to provide multiple models root directories. Using the --custom-resolver switch, you can provide a custom resolver implementation. The value of the switch can be any command which is directly executable by the underlying operating system (such as a batch script on Windows or a shell script on Linux/Unix). When a model element needs to be resolved, this command is executed with the URN of the element to resolve passed as the last parameter. The command can provide other parameters as well, the element URN will be added automatically as the last one by samm-cli. The resolved model definition is expected to be output to the stdout in Turtle format. In this way the extension can be flexibly done in any programming language/script language, including complex logic if necessary. Using the --github switch, you can configure a location in a remote GitHub repository as models root, e.g., eclipse-esmf/esmf-sdk. Optionally, you can also provide --github-directory to set the remote directory and --github-branch or --github-tag to set the branch name or tag, respectively. If the repository is private, you can also pass --github-token and set a fine-grained access token; the token needs at least \"Contents\" repository read permissions. When using an Aspect Model URN as input to a command (such as urn:samm:org.eclipse.esmf.example:1.0.0#Aspect), you must also provide at least one of the switches mentioned above (--models-root, --custom-resolver or --github), otherwise samm-cli will not know where to find the corresonding file(s). Every specification is based on one Aspect, which needs a separately defined server URL where the given aspect will be. The URL will be defined as string with the -b option, i.e.: https://www.example.org. The default URL, using the above defined --api-base-url, would result in https://www.example.org/api/v1/{tenantId}/;. By default, {tenantId} followed by the Aspect’s name is used as path, with the aspect name converted from CamelCase to kebab-case. The default path can be changed with the --resource-path switch. If the path is defined further, for example using --resource-path \"/resources/{resourceId}\", the resulting URL would be: https://www.example.org/resources/{resourceId}. It will be required to specify the parameter, in case there is an additional parameter defined. This has to be done in JSON or in YAML, depending on the kind of specification chosen. For example: With the option --resource-path \"/resources/{resourceId}\" the generator constructs the URL https://www.example.org/resources/{resourceId} and then the --parameter-file defines the parameter resourceId in YAML: resourceId: name: resourceId in: path description: An example resource Id. required: true schema: type: string Definitions of the parameters must correspond to the specification of the OpenAPI Parameter Object. A template can be used for more specific customization - parameter --template-file. The template is a document in the OpenAPI format, with one crucial difference - the presence of a templated Paths Object paths.__DEFAULT_QUERIES_TEMPLATE__. All values not defined by the generator will be taken from the template. For generator-defined Aspect Model resources, the values can be taken from the corresponding Operation Object template paths.__DEFAULT_QUERIES_TEMPLATE__. For example, the template file could look like this: info: termsOfService: 'https://example.com/terms-of-service' servers: - url: https://{environment}.example.com/api/v1 variables: environment: default: api enum: - api - sandbox-api components: responses: InternalServerError: description: An error occurred while processing the request. content: application/json: schema: $ref: '#/components/schemas/ErrorResponse' paths: /status: get: tags: - Maintenance operationId: getHealthStatus description: Check the health status of the service. responses: \"200\": description: The service is up and running. \"503\": description: The service is down. __DEFAULT_QUERIES_TEMPLATE__: get: parameters: - name: request-id in: header description: The unique identifier for the request. If it isn't provided, it will be auto-generated. required: false schema: type: string format: uuid responses: \"500\": $ref: '#/components/responses/InternalServerError' post: parameters: - name: request-id in: header description: The unique identifier for the request. If it isn't provided, it will be auto-generated. required: false schema: type: string format: uuid The full command for the native executable samm-cli would be: samm aspect AspectModel.ttl to openapi -b \"https://www.example.org\" -r \"/resources/{resourceId}\" -p fileLocation For the Java version of samm-cli, the full command would result in: java -jar samm-cli-2.9.8.jar aspect AspectModel.ttl to openapi -b \"https://www.example.org\" -r \"/resources/{resourceId}\" -p fileLocation For example, to configure OAuth2 authentication the template could look like this: security: - OAuth2: - read:aspects components: securitySchemes: OAuth2: type: oauth2 flows: implicit: authorizationUrl: https://{environment}.example.com/oauth2/authorize tokenUrl: https://{environment}.example.com/oauth2/token scopes: read:aspects: Read access to aspects write:aspects: Write access to aspects paths: __DEFAULT_QUERIES_TEMPLATE__: post: security: - OAuth2: - read:aspects - write:aspects In this section, a detailed description of the mapping between individual Aspect elements and the OpenAPI specification is given. To make it easier to follow, the mapping is explained based on a concrete example, divided into logically coherent blocks. Please bear in mind that these blocks are snippets or fragments of a larger whole; viewed in isolation they do not necessarily form a valid or meaningful Aspect Model or OpenAPI specification. Please consider the following model fragment, with the attention focused on the numbered elements: @prefix : . (1) @prefix samm: . :Test a samm:Aspect; (3) samm:preferredName \"TestAspect\"@en ; (2) samm:preferredName \"TestAspekt\"@de . 1 prefix used to build the full URN of :Test Aspect 2 the preferred name of the Aspect in language of user’s choice 3 the name of the Aspect For the generated OpenAPI specification, the following mapping would apply: { \"openapi\" : \"3.0.3\", \"info\" : { \"title\" : \"TestAspect\", (2) (3) \"version\" : \"v1\" (1) } } 1 depending on parameters used when generating the specification, this is either the major version of the full Aspect URN (2.0.0), or it can be the full version (v2.0.0), if using -sv (semantic version) command line switch 2 if present, samm:preferredName is used as the value for the title element of the specification 3 as samm:preferredName is an optional element, in cases when it is missing the name of the Aspect is used instead The version information as described above is also used in the URL definitions of the servers block of the specification: { \"servers\" : [ { \"url\" : \"http://example.com/api/v1\", (1) \"variables\" : { \"api-version\" : { \"default\" : \"v1\" (1) } } } ] } The name of the Aspect is used to generate several important OpenAPI artifacts, like the path definitions for the API: { \"paths\" : { \"/{tenant-id}/test\" : { (3) \"get\" : { \"tags\" : [ \"Test\" ], (3) \"operationId\" : \"getTest\" (3) } } } } and the definitions for request bodies and responses in the corresponding blocks (requestBodies and responses) of the OpenAPI specification (example omitted for simplicity). For each Aspect in the model, an entry in the components/schemas part of the OpenAPI specification is generated. For an example Aspect from the following fragment: :Test a samm:Aspect; (1) samm:properties ( :prop1 (2) [ samm:property :prop2; samm:payloadName \"givenName\"; ] (3) [ samm:property :prop3; samm:optional true; ] ). (4) :prop1 a samm:Property; samm:description \"Description of Property1\"@en; (5) samm:characteristic :Enum. (6) an entry like the one given in the following JSON will be generated: \"Test\" : { (1) \"type\" : \"object\", \"properties\" : { \"prop1\" : { (2) \"description\" : \"Description of Property1\", (5) \"$ref\" : \"#/components/schemas/urn_samm_test_2.0.0_Enum\" (6) }, \"givenName\" : { (3) \"$ref\" : \"#/components/schemas/urn_samm_test_2.0.0_EntityChar\" }, \"prop3\" : { (4) \"$ref\" : \"#/components/schemas/urn_samm_test_2.0.0_StringCharacteristic\" } }, \"required\" : [ \"prop1\", \"givenName\" ] (2) (3) } 1 the name of the Aspect is used to name the schema object for the aspect 2 with plain property references, the name of the property is used to name the property definition 3 in cases where a payload name is defined on a specific property, it is used in preference to the plain property name 4 if the property use is also defined as optional, the property will not be included in the list of the required properties 5 the values of samm:description elements in property definitions are included in the generated JSON 6 for each of the properties characteristics an entry in components/schemas is generated and referenced here; if the characteristic is of complex type, the whole procedure is applied recursively to the complex type’s properties If the Aspect also has a non-empty list of operations defined, like the one in the following example: :AspectWithOperation a samm:Aspect ; samm:properties ( ) ; samm:operations ( :testOperation ) . :testOperation a samm:Operation ; samm:input ( :input ) ; (1) samm:output :output . (2) :output a samm:Property ; samm:characteristic samm-c:Text . (3) :input a samm:Property ; samm:characteristic samm-c:Text . (4) then additional entries are added to the generated OpenAPI specification. First, there is an additional entry in the paths section of the specification: /{tenant-id}/aspect-with-operation/operations. The available operations are then added to the components/schemas part: { \"Operation\" : { \"allOf\" : [ { \"$ref\" : \"#/components/schemas/JsonRpc\" }, { \"properties\" : { \"params\" : { \"type\" : \"object\", \"required\" : [ \"input\" ], (1) \"properties\" : { \"input\" : { (1) \"$ref\" : \"#/components/schemas/urn_samm_org.eclipse.esmf.samm_characteristic_2.0.0_Text\" (3) } } }, \"method\" : { \"type\" : \"string\", \"description\" : \"The method name\", \"example\" : \"testOperation\" } } } ] }, \"OperationResponse\" : { \"allOf\" : [ { \"$ref\" : \"#/components/schemas/JsonRpc\" }, { \"properties\" : { \"result\" : { \"type\" : \"object\", \"required\" : [ \"output\" ], (2) \"properties\" : { \"output\" : { (2) \"$ref\" : \"#/components/schemas/urn_samm_org.eclipse.esmf.samm_characteristic_2.0.0_Text\" (4) } } } } } ] } } 1 the names of the input 2 and output parameters are reflected in the properties generated for the request/response objects 3 the characteristics are generated 4 and referenced as described in the point 6 of the section \"Mapping of Aspect and its properties\" As usual, corresponding entries referencing the definitions above are added to the requestBodies and responses sections (examples omitted for simplicity). For technical reasons, there may be a slight variation in the generated JSON depending on whether the aspect has one or more operations defined. There are some additional JSON entries generated for complex types related to various types of collections to facilitate access to the individual elements of these collections via paging. As these entries are rather of static character without direct references to any aspect elements, it suffices here to give a short overview about which kind of paging is available for which type of collection: a general Collection - cursor and/or offset based paging TimeSeries - cursor, offset and/or time based paging For all these paging mechanisms, an additional entry with the name PagingSchema is generated in the components/schemas part of the specification, which is then used as the main response schema for the Aspect. Basically, instead of a single Aspect, a collection of Aspects is returned, together with optional total number of Aspects available in the collection: \"PagingSchema\" : { \"type\" : \"object\", \"properties\" : { \"items\" : { \"type\" : \"array\", \"items\" : { \"$ref\" : \"#/components/schemas/Test\" } }, \"totalItems\" : { \"type\" : \"number\" } } } Depending on the concrete paging model selected, there can be additional properties in the PagingSchema object. For cursor based paging, the cursor object denotes the position of the returned Aspects in relation to some other uniquely identifiable Aspect (before or after it): \"cursor\" : { \"type\" : \"object\", \"properties\" : { \"before\" : { \"type\" : \"string\", \"format\" : \"uuid\" }, \"after\" : { \"type\" : \"string\", \"format\" : \"uuid\" } } }, For offset and time based paging, the data is returned in batches of requested size (\"pages\"), described using the following properties (the meaning of which is self explanatory): \"totalPages\" : { \"type\" : \"number\" }, \"pageSize\" : { \"type\" : \"number\" }, \"currentPage\" : { \"type\" : \"number\" } In addition to the PagingSchema object, also several new parameters are added to the request parameters section of the generated document, with the help of which the size and/or the relative position of the returned data can be controlled. All paging mechanisms have the following parameters in common, the meaning of which can be discerned from their descriptions: { \"name\" : \"count\", \"in\" : \"query\", \"description\" : \"Number of items to return per call.\", \"required\" : false, \"schema\" : { \"type\" : \"number\" } }, { \"name\" : \"totalItemCount\", \"in\" : \"query\", \"description\" : \"Flag that indicates that the total counts should be returned.\", \"required\" : false, \"schema\" : { \"type\" : \"boolean\" } } Depending on the exact paging model selected, additional paging specific parameters are available. For offset based paging: \"name\" : \"start\", \"in\" : \"query\", \"description\" : \"Starting index which is starting by 0\", \"required\" : false, \"schema\" : { \"type\" : \"number\" } For cursor based paging: { \"name\" : \"previous\", \"in\" : \"query\", \"description\" : \"URL to request the previous items. An empty value indicates there are no previous items.\", \"required\" : false, \"schema\" : { \"type\" : \"string\", \"format\" : \"uri\" } },{ \"name\" : \"next\", \"in\" : \"query\", \"description\" : \"URL to request the next items. An empty value indicates there are no other items.\", \"required\" : false, \"schema\" : { \"type\" : \"string\", \"format\" : \"uri\" } }, { \"name\" : \"before\", \"in\" : \"query\", \"description\" : \"The cursor that points to the start of the page of items that has been returned.\", \"required\" : false, \"schema\" : { \"type\" : \"string\", \"format\" : \"uuid\" } }, { \"name\" : \"after\", \"in\" : \"query\", \"description\" : \"The cursor that points to the end of items that has been returned.\", \"required\" : false, \"schema\" : { \"type\" : \"string\", \"format\" : \"uuid\" } } And finally for the time based paging: { \"name\" : \"since\", \"in\" : \"query\", \"description\" : \"A timestamp that points to the start of the time-based data.\", \"required\" : false, \"schema\" : { \"type\" : \"string\", \"format\" : \"date-time\" } }, { \"name\" : \"until\", \"in\" : \"query\", \"description\" : \"A timestamp that points to the end of the time-based data.\", \"required\" : false, \"schema\" : { \"type\" : \"string\", \"format\" : \"date-time\" } }, { \"name\" : \"limit\", \"in\" : \"query\", \"description\" : \"Number of items to return per call.\", \"required\" : false, \"schema\" : { \"type\" : \"number\" } } As with OpenAPI, every AsyncAPI specification is based on one Aspect. Each Aspect is associated with one channel address. The channel address is set as string using with`--channel-address` or -ca option, e.g.: -ca 123-456/789-012/test/1.0.0/Aspect. The default channel address is derived from the Aspect’s URN and is constructed using the pattern {namespace}/{version}/{aspectName}. The full command for the native executable samm-cli would be: samm aspect AspectModel.ttl to asyncapi -ca \"123-456/789-012/test/1.0.0/Aspect\" For the Java version of samm-cli, the corresponding full command is: java -jar samm-cli-2.9.8.jar aspect AspectModel.ttl to asyncapi -ca \"123-456/789-012/test/1.0.0/Aspect\" In this section, a detailed description of the mapping between individual Aspect elements and the AsyncAPI specification is given. To make it easier to follow, the mapping is explained based on a concrete example, divided into logically coherent blocks. Please bear in mind that these blocks are snippets or fragments of a larger whole; viewed in isolation they do not necessarily form a valid or meaningful Aspect Model or AsyncAPI specification. Please consider the following model fragment, with the attention focused on the numbered elements: @prefix : . (1) @prefix samm: . :Movement a samm:Aspect ; (3) samm:name \"Movement\" ; samm:preferredName \"My Movement Aspect\"@en ; (2) samm:description \"Aspect for movement information\"@en . (4) 1 prefix used to build the full URN of :Movement Aspect 2 the preferred name of the Aspect in the language of the user’s choice 3 the name of the Aspect 4 the description of the Aspect For the generated AsyncAPI specification, the following mapping would apply: { \"asyncapi\" : \"3.0.0\", \"info\" : { \"title\" : \"My Movement Aspect MQTT API\", (2) \"version\" : \"v1\", (1) \"description\" : \"Aspect for movement information\" (3) } } 1 depending on parameters used when generating the specification, this is either the major version of the full Aspect URN (2.0.0), or it can be the full version (v2.0.0), if using -sv (semantic version) command line switch 2 as samm:preferredName is used as the value for the title element of the specification (MQTT API defined automatically) 3 as samm:description is an optional element The name of the Aspect is used to generate parts of the AsyncAPI specification, such as the channel definitions for the API: { \"channels\" : { \"Movement\" : { (3) \"address\" : \"movement/0.0.1/Movement\", (3) \"description\" : \"This channel for updating Movement Aspect.\", (3) \"parameters\" : { \"namespace\" : \"movement\", \"version\" : \"0.0.1\", \"aspect-name\" : \"Movement\" (3) }, \"messages\" : {} } } } The AsyncAPI specification is generated based on SAMM Operations and Events. This section describes how specification parts are generated for Operations. If the Aspect also has a non-empty list of Operations defined, such as the one in the following example: :Movement a samm:Aspect ; samm:preferredName \"movement\"@en ; samm:description \"Aspect for movement information\"@en ; samm:properties ( ) ; samm:operations ( :getSpeed ) ; samm:events ( ) . :getSpeed a samm:Operation ; samm:preferredName \"Get speed\"@en ; samm:description \"Returns the current speed\"@en ; samm:input ( :getSpeedInput ) ; (1) samm:output :getSpeedOutput . (2) :getSpeedOutput a samm:Property ; samm:preferredName \"getSpeed output\"@en ; samm:description \"Return value of the getSpeed operation\"@en ; samm:characteristic :OutputCharacteristic . :OutputCharacteristic a samm:Characteristic ; samm:preferredName \"Output\"@en ; samm:description \"Describes the output of the getSpeed operation\"@en ; samm:dataType :OutputEntity . :OutputEntity a samm:Entity ; samm:preferredName \"Output entity\"@en ; samm:description \"The structured response of getSpeed\"@en ; samm:properties ( :outputEntityMessage ) . :outputEntityMessage a samm:Property ; samm:characteristic samm-c:Text . (3) :getSpeedInput a samm:Property ; samm:preferredName \"getSpeed input\"@en ; samm:description \"The input to the getSpeed operation\"@en ; samm:characteristic samm-c:Text . (4) operations will be generated in some places of AsyncAPI specification: operations section, channel messages section and schemas section: { \"channels\" : { \"Movement\" : { \"address\" : \"movement/0.0.1/Movement\", \"description\" : \"This channel for updating Movement Aspect.\", \"parameters\" : { \"namespace\" : \"movement\", \"version\" : \"0.0.1\", \"aspect-name\" : \"Movement\" }, \"messages\" : { \"getSpeedInput\" : { (1) \"$ref\" : \"#/components/messages/getSpeedInput\" (1) }, \"getSpeedOutput\" : { (2) \"$ref\" : \"#/components/messages/getSpeedOutput\" (2) } } } }, \"operations\" : { \"getSpeedInput\" : { \"action\" : \"receive\", (5) \"channel\" : { \"$ref\" : \"#/channels/Movement\" }, \"messages\" : [ { \"$ref\" : \"#/channels/Movement/messages/getSpeedInput\" (1) } ] }, \"getSpeedOutput\" : { (2) \"action\" : \"send\", (5) \"channel\" : { \"$ref\" : \"#/channels/Movement\" }, \"messages\" : [ { \"$ref\" : \"#/channels/Movement/messages/getSpeedOutput\" (2) } ] } }, \"components\" : { \"messages\" : { \"getSpeedInput\" : { (1) (4) \"name\" : \"getSpeedInput\", (1) \"title\" : \"getSpeed input\", \"summary\" : \"The input to the getSpeed operation\", \"content-type\" : \"application/json\", \"payload\" : { \"$ref\" : \"#/components/schemas/getSpeedInput\" (1) } }, \"getSpeedOutput\" : { (2) (4) \"name\" : \"getSpeedOutput\", (2) \"title\" : \"getSpeed output\", \"summary\" : \"Return value of the getSpeed operation\", \"content-type\" : \"application/json\", \"payload\" : { \"$ref\" : \"#/components/schemas/getSpeedOutput\" (2) } } }, \"schemas\" : { \"getSpeedInput\" : { (1) (3) \"type\" : \"string\", \"description\" : \"The input to the getSpeed operation\" }, \"getSpeedOutput\" : { (2) (3) \"type\" : \"string\", \"description\" : \"Return value of the getSpeed operation\" } } } } 1 the names of the input 2 the names of the output 3 the characteristics are generated 4 the meta information of input/output 5 'send' (for output) action: map to a publish operation in AsyncAPI, 'receive' (for input) action: map to a subscribe operation This section describes the mapping between SAMM Events and the AsyncAPI specification. If the Aspect also has a non-empty list of events defined, like the one in the following example: :Movement a samm:Aspect ; samm:preferredName \"movement\"@en ; samm:description \"Aspect for movement information\"@en ; samm:properties ( ) ; samm:operations ( ) ; samm:events ( :SpeedUpdateEvent ) . :SpeedUpdateEvent a samm:Event ; samm:preferredName \"Speed Update\"@en ; samm:description \"This is event for update speed property\"@en ; samm:parameters ( :updatedSpeed :updateAcceleration ) . :updatedSpeed a samm:Property ; samm:preferredName \"updated speed\"@en ; samm:description \"the updated speed value\"@en ; samm:characteristic samm-c:Text . :updateAcceleration a samm:Property ; samm:preferredName \"update acceleration\"@en ; samm:description \"the updated acceleration value\"@en ; samm:characteristic samm-c:Text . events will be generated in some places of AsyncAPI specification: operations section, channel messages section and schemas section: { \"channels\" : { \"Movement\" : { \"address\" : \"movement/0.0.1/Movement\", \"description\" : \"This channel for updating Movement Aspect.\", \"parameters\" : { \"namespace\" : \"movement\", \"version\" : \"0.0.1\", \"aspect-name\" : \"Movement\" }, \"massages\" : { \"SpeedUpdateEvent\" : { \"$ref\" : \"#/components/messages/SpeedUpdateEvent\" (1) }, } } }, \"operations\" : { \"SpeedUpdateEvent\" : { \"action\" : \"receive\", (5) \"channel\" : { \"$ref\" : \"#/channels/Movement\" }, \"messages\" : [ { \"$ref\" : \"#/channels/Movement/messages/SpeedUpdateEvent\" (1) } ] }, }, \"components\" : { \"messages\" : { \"SpeedUpdateEvent\" : { (1) (2) \"name\" : \"SpeedUpdateEvent\", (1) \"title\" : \"Speed Update\", \"summary\" : \"This is event for update speed property\", \"content-type\" : \"application/json\", \"payload\" : { \"$ref\" : \"#/components/schemas/SpeedUpdateEvent\" (1) } } }, \"schemas\" : { \"SpeedUpdateEvent\" : { (1) \"type\" : \"object\", \"properties\" : { \"updatedSpeed\" : { (3) (4) \"title\" : \"updated speed\", \"type\" : \"string\", \"description\" : \"the updated speed value\" }, \"updateAcceleration\" : { (3) (4) \"title\" : \"updated acceleration\", \"type\" : \"string\", \"description\" : \"the updated acceleration value\" } } } } } } 1 the names of the event 2 the meta information of event 3 property of event 4 the characteristics are generated 5 for events available only 'receive' action: map to a subscribe operation An Aspect Model file can contain an Aspect definition as well as other model elements that are defined in the same versioned namespace, as described in the Namespaces section of the specification. Additionally, it is possible to split one versioned namespace across multiple files, for example to define a Characteristic that is usable in multiple Aspects into its own file. In order for SAMM CLI to be able to resolve references to such externally defined model elements, the model files must be organized in a directory structure as follows: namespace/version/name.ttl where namespace corresponds to the hierarchical namespace that is part of the model element’s URN, e.g. com.mycompany.myproduct and version corresponds to the version of the namespace. The resulting directory structure then looks like the following: models root └── com.mycompany.myproduct ├── 1.0.0 │ ├── MyAspect.ttl │ ├── MyEntity.ttl │ └── myProperty.ttl └── 1.1.0 └── MyAspect.ttl The name of the directory shown as models root above can be chosen freely. The SAMM CLI will resolve the file path relative to the input file by following the folder structure described above. Each of the files in the 1.0.0 directory should therefore have an empty prefix declaration such as @prefix : .","title":"SAMM CLI","component":"esmf-developer-guide","version":"master","name":"samm-cli","url":"/esmf-developer-guide/tooling-guide/samm-cli.html","titles":[{"text":"Running the SAMM CLI","id":"samm-cli-getting-started"},{"text":"List of commands","id":"list-of-commands"},{"text":"Configuration of model resolution","id":"configuration-of-model-resolution"},{"text":"Using the CLI to create a JSON OpenAPI Specification","id":"using-the-cli-to-create-a-json-openapi-specification"},{"text":"Configuration of security schemas","id":"configuration-of-security-schemas"},{"text":"Mapping between the Aspect Models and the OpenAPI Specification","id":"mapping-between-the-aspect-models-and-the-openapi-specification"},{"text":"Naming and versioning","id":"naming-and-versioning"},{"text":"Mapping of Aspect and its properties","id":"mapping-of-aspect-and-its-properties"},{"text":"Mapping of Aspect’s operations","id":"mapping-of-aspects-operations"},{"text":"Mapping of Collections","id":"mapping-of-collections"},{"text":"Using the CLI to create a JSON AsyncAPI Specification","id":"using-the-cli-to-create-a-json-asyncapi-specification"},{"text":"Mapping between the Aspect Models and the AsyncAPI Specification","id":"mapping-between-the-aspect-models-and-the-asyncapi-specification"},{"text":"Naming and versioning","id":"naming-and-versioning-2"},{"text":"Mapping of Aspect’s operations","id":"mapping-of-aspects-operations-2"},{"text":"Mapping of Aspect’s events","id":"mapping-of-aspects-events"},{"text":"Understanding the models directory structure","id":"models-directory-structure"}]},"/ame-guide/installation.html":{"text":"Before you install the latest version of the Aspect Model Editor, make sure you have covered the following: Login with administrator permissions to install or uninstall the Aspect Model Editor.

All concepts, possibilities, and restrictions defined by the SAMM Aspect Meta Model are incorporated in the Aspect Model Editor in a convenient way with a smart user flow. In addition to the version you are currently looking at, further versions of this documentation are also available, for example, for previous releases. They can be accessed from the dropdown menu located in the top right corner of this page. Typically, Aspect Models are edited as code, that is, text-based. With the Aspect Model Editor, such code gets visualized so that relationships and dependencies within the model can be understood quickly and easily. Aspect Models can be exported as TTL files and imported from TTL files at any moment during the work on the model. By that, the Aspect Model Editor caters to all working preferences. Two ways of creating Aspect Models: text-based and graphically – with the Aspect Model Editor The Aspect Model Editor focuses on practitioners, such as domain experts or data experts, who intend to efficiently build reusable Aspect Models for the data and data sources of their domain. Especially for expert teams who model Aspects together, the visual representation of Aspect Models provides a low entry barrier and easy understanding, and facilitates collaboration. In addition to that, constant background validation ensures that your Aspect Models correspond to the Semantic Aspect Meta Model (SAMM), enabling the reusability of your Aspect Models and automation of the downstream process steps for your Aspect Models. Create Aspect Models from scratch or import TTL files to start or continue modeling in the Aspect Model Editor. Navigate and edit your Aspect Models conveniently with a collapsed/extended view for your model details, auto-formatting, auto-saving, drag-and-drop of model elements, and many more. Manage namespaces for your Aspect Models. Save and export your Aspect Models and namespaces. Generate JSON/JSON Schema from your Aspect Models. Generate HTML documentation from your Aspect Models. Generate OpenAPI specification from your Aspect Models. Validate your Aspect Models continuously in the background and directly go from the validation results list to those locations in your Aspect Model where validation was not completed successfully. Each Aspect represents a small, encapsulated piece of information about, for example, a product, product component, or any other asset. Aspects enable reusable integration of data sources and offer semantically enriched data, that is, information. With APIs implemented for each Aspect, Aspects offer their information to software solutions, which consume the Aspects' meaningful data for operational or analytical purposes. To do so, Aspect Models make sure that Aspect APIs do not just provide the raw, proprietary data from the underlying data sources but semantically enriched data – data that is meaningful for a domain expert. An Aspect Model describes, for example, the physical unit or the possible value range of a temperature sensor and indicates what a particular temperature at that sensor means with regard to the context of that sensor. Each Aspect references a particular Aspect Model, which, in a machine-readable way, describes how that Aspect is structured – based on the SAMM Aspect Meta Model specification.

Elements that are references from models in another namespace, can only be edited when working in the namespace they belong to. The naming conventions for Aspect Model elements are defined in the Naming Rules (SAMM 2.1.0). The Aspect Model Editor guides you to follow all these SAMM naming conventions for your Aspect Models.

After an Entity a default Property will be added. For Characteristics, you will also find an Add icon on the top to insert a Constraint between the Property and the Characteristic. This also creates a Trait that is connected to the property and constraint. Drag and drop one of the available elements from the Workspace sidebar. You have the option to create new elements or to use already existing elements from other namespaces. In order to prevent formatting issues, it is a best practice to always connect a new element with another element directly after adding it. See also known issues. Use the search dialog in the Search menu to find elements. By selecting an element it will be highlighted and centered in the diagram area. Use the following advanced search possibilities for more specific search results: =position SAMM elements that are named \"position\" *position SAMM elements that contain \"position\" in their name position$ SAMM elements where the name ends with \"position\" In some situations you might want to connect elements manually, e.g., when you want to reuse a Characteristic and connect a second Property to it.

For the correct understanding of Characteristics, see Characteristics and Constraints (SAMM 2.1.0). In the following, handling Characteristics with the Aspect Model Editor will be explained. For a new Characteristic, first choose a Characteristic class value from the drop-down menu of the Characteristic class attribute in the Edit dialog. → This will auto-populate the Edit dialog with the corresponding attribute fields. SAMM allows two kinds of data types: simple types (scalars) and complex types (Entities). For using a simple data type, populate the data type field with a value like xsd:float, xsd:integer or xsd:string (no quotation marks, no spaces), see Data Types (SAMM 2.1.0). Make sure that you do not include a space character as they are not accepted. For using a complex data type, relate this Characteristic with an Entity, which will then be the data type of the Characteristic. An Enumeration Characteristic can have simple data types or complex data types. If your Characteristic is an Enumeration, provide the possible values as a space-separated list of strings, e.g., red yellow green. See also Declaring Enumerations(SAMM 2.1.0). If no data type is selected, string is selected as default for the values. If the Characteristic is an Enumeration and the data type is an Entity, the possible values for this enumeration are the instances of the provided Entity. Structured Value Characteristics allow to semantically describe formatted string-like values like a date, email, or product’s type part number. For example, for such type part numbers, the parts should be semantically described separately and the composition of those into one string should be described via a regular expression. For more background on Structured Values, see Structured Value(SAMM 2.1.0) For Structured Value Characteristics, the following attributes have to be defined: Deconstruction rule name A single choice for choosing a predefined rule or defining a custom rule. Deconstruction rule * If the Custom Rule is selected for the Deconstruction rule name attribute, this input option will be enabled and you can write your own rule. * If anything else is selected, this attribute will be populated with a predefined rule and it is disabled. * For a piece of your regex to correspond with a property in samm-c:elements it needs to be wrapped in round parentheses. This piece with round parentheses is called capture group. Elements Opens up a dialog containing a table with two columns. One column shows all the capture groups from the Deconstruction rule attribute and the second column allows to choose or create a Property for the corresponding capture group. To edit a new Structured Value Characteristic, proceed as follows: In the Edit dialog, choose the Characteristic class StructuredValue. Enter values for the attributes Deconstruction rule name, Deconstruction rule, and Elements. Click Save. → Now you can see the changes in editor. To create a new element from such a Structured Value Characteristic, proceed as follows: Click the Add icon on the Structured Value Characteristic shape. → As a result, a new Property is created. A new Property created from a Structured Value Characteristic, is automatically inserted as an attribute in the Structured Value Characteristic and the (regex) capture group is automatically appended to deconstructionRule. As an attribute for Characteristics, a Unit can be optional or mandatory. If your Characteristic is a Quantifiable (see Characteristics (SAMM 2.1.0)), Unit is an optional attribute (only exception for not having a Unit: unit-less countable Quantifiable). For the Characteristic classes Duration and Measurement the Unit attribute is mandatory. Entering a value to the Unit attribute field is done through a search: Start typing the Unit you are searching for. You may also use advanced search syntax (=metre, *metre, perSecond$) as explained in Search Elements. Select your Unit from the drop-down menu of the Unit attribute. For a complete list of supported Units refer to the Unit Catalog (SAMM 2.1.0). Further explanations about using Units can be found in Characteristics (SAMM 2.1.0).

In case you want to extract a part of an Aspect Model graph into a \"shared model\" please make sure to delete the Aspect element from the model. Creating \"shared models\" proves advantageous, particularly when developing broadly defined elements for use in various Aspect Models. After deleting the Aspect element, you can choose a new file name to describe the resulting \"shared model\". This file can then be saved in the workspace like any other ttl file. As a result, you create a valid ttl file, which just does not contain the \"Aspect\" element. From all other points of view the lifecycle of such a model is similar with the one of an Aspect Model. Such a model can be referenced from multiple other shared models and Aspect Models. As soon as you define such a reference the \"shared model\" it treated like a dependency from the Aspect Model’s perspective. When using the \"shared model\", the process is the same as with references, see Use references. In case you need to convert a \"shared model\" into an Aspect Model, simply add an Aspect element as the first element in the graph.","title":"Shared models","component":"ame-guide","version":"master","name":"shared-models","url":"/ame-guide/modeling/shared-models.html","titles":[]},"/ame-guide/modeling/start-new-models.html":{"text":"To start modeling, proceed as follows: Click the File menu and select New…​.

Explanation This can be caused by previously generated TTL with certain syntax errors. This can be caused by renaming an Entity. Error When loading a TTL file to edit an Aspect Model, an Error when loading RDF is shown. Explanation This is caused by fundamental syntax errors in the TTL being loaded. Potential underlying root cause: The used SAMM version is not supported by this version of the Aspect Model Editor. Workaround Check that you have not missed parts of the TTL file. Also check against syntax errors consulting Namespaces and versions (SAMM 2.1.0). Error \"resultMessage\":\"The dataType (see value) that is used as dataType on the Characteristic (see focusNode) is neither an allowed XSD or RDF type nor a type that is defined as rdfs:Class.\" \"focusNode\":\"urn:samm:com.your.example.namespace:aspect-model:AngularVelocityHistory:1.1.1#AngularVelocityTimeSeries\" \"resultPath\":\"urn:samm:com.your.example.namespace:meta-model:1.2.0#dataType\" \"resultSeverity\":\"http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#Violation\" \"value\":\"urn:samm:com.your.example.namespace:aspect-model:AngularVelocityHistory:1.1.1#AngularVelocityTimeSeriesEntity\" Explanation This can happen if a namespace version is not supported anymore or when setting an unsupported dataType. Workaround Wrong data type Check that the data types you are using are correct, see Datatypes (SAMM 2.1.0) Unsupported Namespaces Check that your currently used namespaces in the TTL file are up to date. Hint: You can check the current default namespaces via looking at the Movement Example code. Display the Movement Example by clicking the New/Load icon > Create/Upload Aspect Model > Models > Movement Example. Error When loading a TTL file, units are not loaded correctly. After triggering a validation, this validation does not stop and the user cannot continue to edit the Aspect Model. Explanation The backend validation does not complete successfully. One reason can be that the backend service is not running. Workaround Restart the Aspect Model Editor. Fixed for Aspect Model Editor 2.1.0 and higher: If the backend is not available, a message is shown to the user. Error After triggering a validation, the validation runs into a timeout. Explanation The backend validation does not complete successfully. One reason can be that the backend service is not running. Workaround Restart the Aspect Model Editor. Error While the element edit view is displayed and you adjust something in the editor, the edit view is not updated. Workaround Close the edit elements view and reopen it. Error As soon as elements overlap, the last created one is displayed above all others. Workaround Move all elements to a free space so that you can see them again. Error During installation, some files cannot be written. Popup allows retry or abort. Explanation File path restriction does not allow writing a file. Workaround Install on C:\\AME or similar without going deeper in hierarchy. Error Trying to add entity / relate entity with Characteristic does not work. Explanation This is the intended behavior. If your Characteristic is a predefined instance, its data type is immutable. In this case you cannot relate it with an Entity. Workaround Should you need to relate this Characteristic with an Entity, change your Characteristic class first and modify your own Entity as suitable. Error During usage, a key press (e.g. delete to delete an element) is not recognized. Instead, no action happens. Explanation The Aspect Model Editor does not support keystrokes like \"del\". See Getting started. Workaround Use mouse actions instead, e.g. the toolbar on the top with the Delete icon. You can also change your focus back and forth to try again pressing the delete key.

This can for example happen when there are elements in the Aspect Model that are not connected to the Aspect (directly or via other elements) Workaround It is the preferred working style to keep all elements connected to the Aspect (i.e. avoiding the use of \"isolated elements\") Use dragging an element or auto-format to find if another element is hidden below it Use search to search and focus an element Use zoom or fit to screen or map preview to detect elements that may be far away Error After importing elements from workspace the element subtree overlaps the present model or the overlap happened from other reason Explanation This happens due autoformat not being enabled or/and the hierarchical layout is disabled Workaround One of the following options can be used to fix the problem: Right click on the imported element, select the option \"Select all references\" and drag the elements to a free space Manually select the desired elements and drag them to a free space Switch to hierarchical layout from settings and: (autoformat disabled) Click format button from toolbar.

For generating UI components it uses schematics under the hood. Schematics is a template-based code generator that supports complex logic. It is a set of instructions for transforming a software project by generating or modifying code. Schematics is packaged into collections and can be installed with npm or yarn. Afterwards new components can be easily created by running a command in the CLI and focusing on linking everything easily afterwards. Examples: parent-child communication, event emitters for customizing actions, passing data back and forth. The SAMM schematics collection is a powerful tool for creating, modifying, and maintaining any software project. It is particularly useful for customizing Angular projects or components to suit custom needs of any organization. The Aspect Model loader can be used to load an Aspect Model, to traverse and access the different information a model provides (units, descriptions, constraints, etc.), and to implement generic frontends, which are capable to automatically adapt to the underling Aspect Model. For example a new added property and the related value could be shown in the UI including all information (name, description and unit) without changing any line of code.","title":"Introduction","component":"js-sdk-guide","version":"master","name":"index","url":"/js-sdk-guide/index.html","titles":[{"text":"SAMM Schematics","id":"samm-schematics"},{"text":"Aspect Model Loader","id":"aspect-model-loader"}]},"/js-sdk-guide/tooling-guide/card-generation.html":{"text":"Before generating a card component refer to the internationalization file. In the example, a brand-new application was generated using the command: ng new app demo-schematics --no-standalone A schematics will be generated using the following command: ng generate [collection-name]:[schematics-name] For demonstration purposes, the Movement.ttl Aspect Model will be used. Below is a detailed representation of the command-line interface steps which generates a card component using the Movement.ttl Aspect Model file by running the command. Before running any schematics commands make sure you are in the Angular project folder where you want to generate the new component. Component generation is achieved by running either of the following commands: ng generate @esmf/semantic-ui-schematics:card ng g @esmf/semantic-ui-schematics:card The Angular folder where the component generation takes place should contain another folder with the .ttl files. After going through the wizard at least once, a config file will be auto-generated. The first prompt allows you to load a config file or start from scratch by loading one or multiple Aspect Model files. When you decide to create a new configuration file, you will be prompted to specify a name for your config file. This provided name will be integrated into the default naming structure for the config file. The naming structure is -wizard.config.json. Here, is the name that you provide when prompted. For example, if you enter myConfig when prompted for the config file name, your new config file will be named myConfig-wizard.config.json. When you decide to load a pre-existing config file, the system will display the result as follows: This will give access to the folder structure and by using a FUZZY search mechanism can provide the possibility to input the pre-existing config file. The config file will now be named based on your input -wizard.config.json, and can be found in the root folder of the project. If no pre-existing config file is loaded, then there is an option to choose for one or multiple Aspect Model files from the folder structure, using the same FUZZY search mechanism. An Aspect or an Entity must be chosen in order for the card to be created. This can be done in this step by choosing from a list. Some properties may be omitted. This can be done in the following step. The card can sort based on a property. In this step the default one can be chosen. The command bar is displayed above the cards, and it holds the controls for searching and filtering the data inside the card. This is shown only if the 'yes' option is chosen in the provided input. If you select to have a command bar, another prompt question will appear for selecting the additional functionality attached to it. In the example provided, only the search functionality will be available. The search input is present allowing you to filter the existing data in the card if the data is handled on the client side or request new data. This can be decided in the next steps. The filtered data will be displayed after pressing the search button next to the search field. The search input will filter the data ONLY by the existing STRING properties in the chosen Aspect Model. Once the search functionality has been enabled, the next step is to choose the default language for remote access. This language selection determines the language used in the statement when accessing the system remotely. When the option \"Quick filters for properties of type date\" is selected, an additional step appears that allows the selection of each property of type date. During this step, you can choose the specific type of filter to apply for these date properties. There are three options available for selection: Single Date Picker: This option allows the selection of a single date, acting as a \"from\" date. It’s suitable for scenarios where a specific starting point needs to be defined. Range Date Picker start or end date: With this option, you can select either a single \"from\" or \"to\" date. It offers flexibility in filtering by enabling the specification of either the start or the end of a date range. For the Date Range Picker, where both the \"from\" and \"to\" dates are optional, users can directly select and delete these values within the input field. By either blurring the field or pressing \"Enter,\" the specified dates are removed and thus selected for filtering. If only a \"from\" date is provided, it will be recognized and applied as a starting point for the filter. Conversely, if only a \"to\" date is entered, it will be treated and displayed as an \"until\" condition in the chip list. Date Range Picker start and end date: This option requires the selection of both \"from\" and \"to\" dates, defining a complete date range. It’s ideal for situations where a precise period needs to be specified for filtering. In the Date Range Picker, where both \"from\" and \"to\" dates are required, users must enter both dates. If these dates are removed, an error message will appear below the input field, detailing what went wrong. Each of these options provides a different way to apply date-based filtering, enhancing the user’s ability to narrow down the data according to specific time frames. After generating a component, you can pass the data from the parent to the child components and also the other way around. There is a prompt present which determines if the data should be handled on the client side or remote via an API call.

However, when creating the table using schematics, you can let schematics create additional, customizable columns. One way to render the content of the column is to use the Angular ng-template directive, another way is to create a custom component to individually render the content of a column. The latter choice is recommended especially if business logic is involved for rendering the content. The following example show how to implement and offer a column with graphical content using Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG). This is the recommended approach if no business logic is involved. Let’s say that the table row includes an attribute speedLimitWarning that can be one of red, yellow or green. Drawing a circle and filling it with one of these colors can be done in the following way inside a ng-template: There is a ng-template variable speedLimitWarningColor that is defined using in combination with the prefix let-, and its value is set by the variable speedLimitWarning within the context of the calling parent component (the table column). At the table column, add a ng-container statement as follows: {{ 'movement.v100.speedLimitWarning.preferredName' | transloco }} This embeds the ng-template with the id speedLimitWarningTemplate inside the column and uses the current row as the context for the child component. This is the recommended approach if business logic is involved for rendering the component. In this example, depending on a percentage between 0% and 100% of remaining battery power, the color of the bar is changed. By creating a new UI component, we keep the rendering isolated from the generated table UI component. ng generate component svg-bar-indicator By default, the new component got the selector app-svg-bar-indicator, so it can be used in any Angular template: By default, only the text svg-bar-indicator works! is printed out. Let’s replace that by a SVG image. Change file svg-bar-indicator.component.html as follows: 80% This draws a fixed green bar with a width of 80 pixels and a text with \"80%\". Change file svg-bar-indicator.component.html as follows: {{ indicatorValue }}% This introduces the two component properties indicatorValue and indicatorValue. indicatorValue specifies the length of the bar and the text label, indicatorColor specifies the color of the bar. Now, the necessary modifications in svg-bar-indicator.component.ts: import { Component, OnInit, Input, OnChanges, SimpleChanges } from '@angular/core'; @Component({ selector: 'app-svg-bar-indicator', templateUrl: './svg-bar-indicator.component.html', styleUrls: ['./svg-bar-indicator.component.css'] }) export class SvgBarIndicatorComponent implements OnInit, OnChanges { @Input() indicatorValue: number = 0; indicatorColor: string; constructor() { this.indicatorColor = 'lightgreen'; } ngOnInit(): void { } ngOnChanges(changes: SimpleChanges): void { if (changes.indicatorValue.currentValue >= 20) { this.indicatorColor = 'lightgreen'; } else if (changes.indicatorValue.currentValue >= 10) { this.indicatorColor = 'yellow'; } else { this.indicatorColor = 'red'; } } } The @Input() decorator allows that this property can receive its value from the parent component. On changes of the property indicatorValue, there is a small section of business logic that defines the fill color of the bar, depending on the value of indicatorValue. You can directly integrate this component in the respective column of the table as follows: {{ 'movement.v100.batteryLevel.preferredName' | transloco }}","title":"Custom Column Renderer","component":"js-sdk-guide","version":"master","name":"table-custom-column","url":"/js-sdk-guide/tooling-guide/table-custom-column.html","titles":[{"text":"Example showing a traffic light in a column","id":"example-showing-a-traffic-light-in-a-column"},{"text":"Alternative A: Render column content using ng-template","id":"alternative-a-render-column-content-using-ng-template"},{"text":"Step A1: Create graphical representation","id":"step-a1-create-graphical-representation"},{"text":"Step A2: Connect the parent component with this child component","id":"step-a2-connect-the-parent-component-with-this-child-component"},{"text":"Alternative B: Render column content using a component","id":"alternative-b-render-column-content-using-a-component"},{"text":"Step B1: Create a new UI component","id":"step-b1-create-a-new-ui-component"},{"text":"Step B2: Create a static SVG image","id":"step-b2-create-a-static-svg-image"},{"text":"Step B3: Create a dynamic SVG image","id":"step-b3-create-a-dynamic-svg-image"},{"text":"Step B4: Connect the parent component with this child component","id":"step-b4-connect-the-parent-component-with-this-child-component"}]},"/js-sdk-guide/tooling-guide/table-generation.html":{"text":"Before generating a table component refer to the internationalization file.

This can be done in the following step. The table can sort the rows based on a property. In this step the default one can be chosen. The table supports custom actions to be configured. These actions will appear in the actions column of the table. In the following prompt you can choose different files or class names to customize the icons. In the generated table the selection custom actions can be observed in the actions column as below. One other thing supported is multiple selection. There is an option to choose to have this feature or not in the following prompt. The generated table containing checkboxes will look like in the following example: The checkboxes are displayed in the first column of the table. One or multiple rows can be selected. The command bar is displayed above the table, and it holds the controls for searching and filtering the data inside the table. This is shown only if the 'yes' option is chosen in the provided input. If you select to have a command bar, another prompt question will appear for selecting the additional functionality attached to it. In the example provided, only the search functionality will be available. The search input is present allowing you to filter the existing data in the table if the data is handled on the client side or request new data. This can be decided in the next steps. The filtered data will be displayed after pressing the search button next to the search field. The search input will filter the data ONLY by the existing STRING properties in the chosen Aspect Model. Once the search functionality has been enabled, the next step is to choose the default language for remote access. This language selection determines the language used in the statement when accessing the system remotely. When the option \"Quick filters for properties of type date\" is selected, an additional step appears that allows the selection of each property of type date. During this step, you can choose the specific type of filter to apply for these date properties. There are three options available for selection: Single Date Picker: This option allows the selection of a single date, acting as a \"from\" date. It’s suitable for scenarios where a specific starting point needs to be defined. Range Date Picker start or end date: With this option, you can select either a single \"from\" or \"to\" date. It offers flexibility in filtering by enabling the specification of either the start or the end of a date range. For the Date Range Picker, where both the \"from\" and \"to\" dates are optional, users can directly select and delete these values within the input field. By either blurring the field or pressing \"Enter,\" the specified dates are removed and thus selected for filtering. If only a \"from\" date is provided, it will be recognized and applied as a starting point for the filter. Conversely, if only a \"to\" date is entered, it will be treated and displayed as an \"until\" condition in the chip list. Date Range Picker start and end date: This option requires the selection of both \"from\" and \"to\" dates, defining a complete date range. It’s ideal for situations where a precise period needs to be specified for filtering. In the Date Range Picker, where both \"from\" and \"to\" dates are required, users must enter both dates. If these dates are removed, an error message will appear below the input field, detailing what went wrong. Each of these options provides a different way to apply date-based filtering, enhancing the user’s ability to narrow down the data according to specific time frames. After generating a component, you can pass the data from the parent to the child components and also the other way around. There is a prompt present which determines if the data should be handled on the client side or remote via an API call. This means that any time you request data, an API endpoint will be called and the result coming from that endpoint will populate the table with a fresh set of data.

Load an aspect model which is self-contained (includes no imports to other ttl file): new AspectModelLoader().loadSelfContainedModel(ttl).subscribe((aspect: Aspect) => { ... }); or if the model contains imports to additional ttl files: new AspectModelLoader().load('', ttl-1, ttl-2, ttl-3).subscribe((aspect: Aspect) => { ... }); If you are using external .ttl files you may need to parse the contents of these files to strings, to be passed to the methods params. This module exposes some helper functions that can be used to find items inside the loaded ttl object. Find a specific model element, and returns it or undefined. let specificElement = loader.findByUrn(options.urnSelectedModelElement) Find a specific model element by name, and returns the found elements. let specificElement = loader.findByName(options.selectedModelName) npm run build to build and to create the library ctix create ./src to update all index files under src.

This guide gives an overview of the components in the Python SDK and shows how to use them. Python Version 3.10 or higher. Check your version with python --version In order to include the packages a Python dependency manager is required; we recommend Python Poetry. The remainder of the guide assumes usage of Poetry. Please refer to the Poetry installation guide. You can check your installed Poetry version with poetry --version Aspect Models are stored as RDF Graphs in .ttl (RDF Turtle) files. The Aspect Model Loader for Python reads one or more Turtle file and parses the Aspect Model. The result is a Python object representing the root Aspect of the Aspect Model. The Aspect has references to all of its children (e.g., Properties and Operations). If you want to work with Aspect Models in your Python solution you should install the Aspect Model Loader for Python and include it into your project. Currently not available To use GitHub release as dependency using Poetry, you need to add it like this: [tool.poetry.dependencies] esmf-aspect-meta-model-python = { git = \"https://github.com/eclipse-esmf/esmf-sdk-py-aspect-model-loader.git\", tag = \"1.0.0\" } for more information on depend on a library located in a git: git dependencies The Python package is an archive with the file ending .tar.gz. If you are working with Poetry, you can easily import that package by adding the local reference to your pyproject.toml [tool.poetry.dependencies] esmf-aspect-meta-model-python = { path = \"path/to/esmf-aspect-meta-model-python-x.y.z.tar.gz\" } To make Poetry recognize your changes, run poetry update Note: The examples below will be using the Movement.ttl Aspect model. Import the Aspect Model Loader in your Python module from esmf_aspect_meta_model_python.loader.aspect_loader import AspectLoader Then create an instance of the AspectLoader and run the method load_aspect_model() from the AspectLoader with from esmf_aspect_meta_model_python.loader.aspect_loader import AspectLoader loader = AspectLoader() aspect = loader.load_aspect_model(PATH_TO_TURTLE_FILE) where the input argument PATH_TO_TURTLE_FILE can either be a Path object or a string representing a path to the ttl file. Both, relative paths and absolute paths are allowed. The return value of load_aspect_model() is an instance of the class DefaultAspect which is declared in the project. If the Aspect Model is separated into multiple .ttl files you can load the Aspect Model by calling the method load_aspect_model_from_multiple_files with a list of file paths. from esmf_aspect_meta_model_python.loader.aspect_loader import AspectLoader loader = AspectLoader() aspect = loader.load_aspect_model_from_multiple_files([ \"file1.ttl\", \"file2.ttl\", \"file3.ttl\", ]) It may happen that the multiple files contain multiple aspect definitions and not only one. In this case it is possible to pass the URN of the Aspect as a hint, so the Loader knows which Aspect to load. from esmf_aspect_meta_model_python.loader.aspect_loader import AspectLoader loader = AspectLoader() aspect_urn = \"urn:samm:org.eclipse.esmf.samm:test:1.0.0#myAspect\" aspect = loader.load_aspect_model_from_multiple_files( [\"file1.ttl\", \"file2.ttl\", \"file3.ttl\"], aspect_urn, ) The urn can either be a string or an instance of rdflib.URIRef. If no urn is passed and the .ttl files contain multiple Aspects, the Aspect Loader will load the first one that is found. The attributes of an Aspect can be accessed with like this: name = aspect.name urn = aspect.urn preferred_names = aspect.preferred_names descriptions = aspect.descriptions meta_model_version = aspect.meta_model_version see = aspect.see properties = aspect.properties operations = aspect.operations events = aspect.events The Aspect Models Editor provides easy ways to generate an example for an interface via Export JSON functions. Based on its structure, you can prepare either a server to send data, or a client to receive via the API. { \"isMoving\": true, \"position\": { \"altitude\": 153, \"latitude\": 9.1781, \"longitude\": 48.80835 }, \"speed\": 0, \"speedLimitWarning\": \"green\" } import random def generate_random_float(): \"\"\"Generate a random float value.\"\"\" return round(random.random(), random.randint(0, 5)) def send_movement_value(): \"\"\"A simple snippet to generate Movement data.\"\"\" traffic_lights = [\"green\", \"yellow\", \"red\"] movement = { \"isMoving\": \"true\" if random.randint(0, 1) else \"false\", \"position\": { \"altitude\": generate_random_float(), \"latitude\": generate_random_float(), \"longitude\": generate_random_float() }, \"speed\": generate_random_float(), \"speedLimitWarning\": traffic_lights[random.randint(0, len(traffic_lights) - 1)] } return movement import json import requests def get_movement(url, method=\"get\"): \"\"\"Get a movement.\"\"\" response = requests.request(method, url) if response.status_code != 200: raise Exception(response.text) else: movement = json.loads(response.text) return movement import json import requests from esmf_aspect_meta_model_python.loader.aspect_loader import AspectLoader loader = AspectLoader() class MovementAspect: def __init__(self, path_to_turtle_file): self._ttl_file_path = path_to_turtle_file self._aspect = loader.load_aspect_model(self._ttl_file_path) self._movement = None self.name = None self.urn = None self.preferred_names = None self.descriptions = None self.meta_model_version = None self.see = None self.properties = None self.operations = None self.events = None self._init_aspect() def _init_aspect(self): self.name = self._aspect.name self.urn = self._aspect.urn self.preferred_names = self._aspect.preferred_names self.descriptions = self._aspect.descriptions self.meta_model_version = self._aspect.meta_model_version self.see = self._aspect.see self.properties = self._aspect.properties self.operations = self._aspect.operations self.events = self._aspect.events self._movement = self._get_current_value() @staticmethod def _get_current_value(): response = requests.request(\"get\", \"url_to_movement_API\") if response.status_code != 200: raise Exception(response.text) else: movement = json.loads(response.text) return movement def refresh_data(self): self._movement = self._get_current_value() @property def is_moving(self): return self._movement[\"isMoving\"] @property def position(self): return self._movement[\"position\"] @property def speed(self): return self._movement[\"speed\"] @property def speed_limit_warning(self): return self._movement[\"speedLimitWarning\"] # Class usage movement = MovementAspect(\"path_to_turtle_file\") # Get a movement values print(movement.is_moving) print(movement.position) print(movement.speed) print(movement.speed_limit_warning) # Show static aspect data print(movement.name) print(movement.urn) print(movement.preferred_names) print(movement.descriptions) print(movement.meta_model_version) print(movement.see) print(movement.properties) print(movement.operations) print(movement.events) Note that the attributes on Aspect Model objects are read-only. The SAMM Aspect Meta Model is defined by multiple Turtle files in the public ESMF GitHub Repository. The project is developed in Java and the releases are published as JAR files. Python applications that work with Aspect Models and RDF may need the SAMM as a Python package. Therefore, the project SAMM Aspect Meta Model for Python was created. It is set up to extract the RDF Turtle files from the released SAMM artifact or its Github repository and pack them into a Python project. If you are not sure whether you need the SAMM Aspect Meta Model as a dependency you probably don’t need it because it does not contain any Python functionality. It is only intended for working with Aspect Models on RDF level. The package is released on PyPI under the name esmf-samm-aspect-meta-model. The package can be imported to a Python project by adding the package as a dependency. If you are using Poetry as a dependency manager you can execute the following commands: poetry add samm-aspect-meta-model poetry install The pyproject.toml file of your project should then include the following: [tool.poetry.dependencies] samm-aspect-meta-model = \"^x.y.z\" In the future it is planned to publish all packages of the Python SDK on public repositories. The authentication will then not be required anymore.","title":"ESMF SDK Python Aspect Model Loader","component":"python-sdk-guide","version":"master","name":"index","url":"/python-sdk-guide/index.html","titles":[{"text":"Getting Started","id":"getting-started"},{"text":"Prerequisites","id":"prerequisites"},{"text":"Aspect Model Loader for Python","id":"aspect-model-loader-for-python"},{"text":"Introduction","id":"introduction"},{"text":"Installation","id":"installation"},{"text":"Installation from package Repository","id":"installation-from-package-repository"},{"text":"PyPI","id":"pypi"},{"text":"GitHub Releases","id":"github-releases"},{"text":"Installation with local package","id":"installation-with-local-package"},{"text":"Loading an Aspect Model","id":"loading-an-aspect-model"},{"text":"Loading an Aspect Model from one *.ttl file","id":"loading-an-aspect-model-from-one-ttl-file"},{"text":"Loading an Aspect Model from multiple files","id":"loading-an-aspect-model-from-multiple-files"},{"text":"Traversing the Aspect Model","id":"traversing-the-aspect-model"},{"text":"Implementation of the OpenAPI specification","id":"implementation-of-the-openapi-specification"},{"text":"A simple example of the server","id":"a-simple-example-of-the-server"},{"text":"Consumer Example","id":"consumer-example"},{"text":"Example of the class for Movement Aspect Model","id":"example-of-the-class-for-movement-aspect-model"},{"text":"SAMM Aspect Meta Model in Python","id":"samm-aspect-meta-model-in-python"},{"text":"Introduction","id":"introduction-2"},{"text":"Installation","id":"installation-2"}]}}})
